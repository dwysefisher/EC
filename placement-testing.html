<p class="first-paragraph">To help students plan educational goals and their degree programs more effectively, several programs provide testing and/or evaluation for course placement. Tests are available to advise students on placement in the areas of foreign language and mathematics.</p>
<a id="english"></a>
<h4>English Placement Policy</h4>

<p>ENG103W (Academic Writing and Research) is a required first year General Education course (unless you have transfer credit, such as a dual credit community college course in English Composition or Advanced Placement credit).</p>

<p>The prerequisite for enrollment in ENG103W is an ACT English sub-score of 21 or higher. If your ACT English sub-score is 21 or higher, you can immediately enroll in ENG103W. </p>

<p><strong>If your ACT English sub-score is 17 or lower, you are required to take and pass ENG095R (Developmental Writing) before taking ENG103W.</strong>  You should register for ENG095R in the fall semester and ENG103W in the spring semester.  Because this is a pass-fail developmental course, the credits for ENG095R do not apply toward the degree, but they are counted as enrolled hours.</p>

<p>If your ACT English sub-score is 18&ndash;20, you have the option to take the English Placement Exam to determine the appropriate placement, ENG095R or ENG103W.  Of course, you can elect not to take the placement exam and enroll in ENG095R.  You can register for the English Placement Examination during this registration process for Early Registration or Jumpstart.</p>

<p>Eureka College offers both ENG095R and ENG103W in the 2015 Summer Session:</p>

	<ul class="body-list">
		<li>ENG095R, June 9 to July 30, Tuesday and Thursday evenings, 6&ndash;8:45pm</li>
		<li>ENG103W, June 8 to July 29, Monday and Wednesday evenings, 6&ndash;8:45pm</li>
	</ul>

<p>If you have already deposited for Fall 2015 at Eureka College and would like to register for either ENG095R or ENG103W this summer, please contact the Office of the Registrar at 467-6896 or <a href="mailto:registrar@eureka.edu">by email</a>.</p>
<a id="mathematics"></a>

<h4>Mathematics Placement Policy</h4>

<p>All students at Eureka College are required to complete one course in mathematics numbered 121 or higher.  The prerequisite for enrollment in one of these courses is either an ACT Mathematics sub-score of 23 or higher, or successful completion of MAT095R (Elementary &amp; Intermediate Algebra).</p>

<p><strong>If your ACT Mathematics sub-score is below 23, you must first pass MAT095R before taking a mathematics course numbered 121 or higher.</strong>  Because this is a pass-fail developmental course, the credits for MAT095R do not apply toward the degree, but they are counted as enrolled hours.</p>

<p>Alternately, you may choose to take the COMPASS Mathematics Placement Examination to determine your appropriate math placement.  If you are interested in taking the COMPASS exam, please contact Jason Zimmerman in the Learning Center at 467-6592, or <a href="mailto:jzimmerman@eureka.edu">by email</a>.</p>

<p>Eureka College offers MAT095R in the 2015 Summer Session:</p>

	<ul class="body-list">
		<li>MAT095R, June 8 to July 27, Mondays, 10&ndash;12:45pm.</li>
	</ul>

<p>If you have already deposited for Fall 2015 at Eureka College and would like to register for MAT095R this summer, please contact the Office of the Registrar at 467-6896 or <a href="mailto:registrar@eureka.edu">by email</a>.</p>

<h3>Foreign Language Placement Policy</h3>

<p>The study of a foreign language is encouraged, but not required, at Eureka College. Completion of two semesters of foreign language coursework will fulfill the Global Awareness requirement in the General Education curriculum.</p>

<p><strong>Students who have had either French or Spanish are encouraged to take the Foreign Language Placement Test.</strong> This test will allow the language professors to place students at the appropriate level.  Although no credit is awarded, students who place out of one or both of the introductory courses in French or Spanish will be considered to have completed one or both of the foreign language courses that fulfill the Global Awareness requirement in the General Education curriculum.</p>
