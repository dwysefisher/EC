<p>As we mourn the loss of Se&ntilde;ora Julia Colorado, it is comforting to share in the memories that we all have of the lively, caring person who was such an integral part of the Eureka College community. As we  move from mourning her loss to celebrating her life, may we move together as one community on this journey of healing.</p>

<p>Yesterday afternoon's campus gathering was a chance for alumni, faculty, staff, students and friends to share  stories and laughter as we honored her memory. Via these stories we know that her love for this institution was abundant. And in this outpouring of support, it is clear that the love this institution has for her will continue to be felt throughout campus and with our alumni around the globe.

<p>We encourage you to share your stories and memories of Julia with others. You can post your memories on our memorial <a href="https://www.facebook.com/SenoraColorado" target="_blank">Facebook page</a> and take a moment to read the memories of others. You can also e-mail your stories to <a href="mailto:cchun@eureka.edu">cchun@eureka.edu</a>, who will compile them for Julia's family to enjoy.</p>

<p>Please continue to support and encourage each other through these challenging times. Utilize the resources we each offer and the support services available through the Student Programs and Services Office. It is the character of this special place to pull together in times of need.</p>
