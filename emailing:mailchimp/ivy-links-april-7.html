<p style="font-family:'Open Sans', Geneva, Arial, sans-serif;color:#3f4041;">Students of Eureka College's Salve Regina Newman Center and Western Illinois University's St. Francis of Assisi Newman Center teamed up for a mission trip to Savannah, Ga.,  March 14&ndash;21. The trip was led by Father Eugene Radosevich of Eureka  and Sister Janice Keenan and Leo Quinn, both of Macomb. The students helped Habitat for Humanity staff with its new ReStore location. They moved sale items, dismantled shelves and painted the store. </p>

<p style="font-family:'Open Sans', Geneva, Arial, sans-serif;color:#3f4041;">"The best part of the trip was seeing how Habitat for Humanity  improves and changes people's lives," said participant Sarah Hall. The purpose of the trip was to serve a community and develop in faith, Sarah said. </p>

<p style="font-family:'Open Sans', Geneva, Arial, sans-serif;color:#3f4041;">Highlights, according to Sarah, were attending St. Patrick's Day Mass and parade in Savannah and staying overnight at St. Bernard Abbey in Cullman, Ala., which features the Ave Maria Grotto. </p>

<p style="font-family:'Open Sans', Geneva, Arial, sans-serif;color:#3f4041;">The partnership with the Newman Centers of the Diocese of Peoria began a few years ago when Father Radosevich had a vision of giving an opportunity to learn through service, missions and faith experiences, Sarah said. </p>

The 2015 Service, Learning and Mission (SLaM) Trip

Partnering with Strong Missions, Costa Rica

Sponsored by Eureka College's Disciples on Campus

by Colton Lott '15, Student Assistant to the Chaplain

<p style="font-family:'Open Sans', Geneva, Arial, sans-serif;color:#3f4041;">[&hellip] The drive to San Isidore de Grecia was on a bus large enough to accommodate our group and give virtually everyone a window seat but small enough to hear the murmurings, musing, surprises, and attempts at translations of both the Spanish and culture witnessed whizzing past.</p>

<p style="font-family:'Open Sans', Geneva, Arial, sans-serif;color:#3f4041;">The accommodations were lovely at Strong Missions, our amazing partners and hosts for the trip. Cabins at the top of the hill with a mess hall below. In between, a lovely outdoor patio overlooking an swimming pool and a Koi pond. Perfect for our group to grow together and yet find a slice of God's wild kingdom. Sometimes we found too much of that wilderness, such as when a spider the size of a half-dollar or the scorpion three inches long decided to climb the cabin walls.</p>
