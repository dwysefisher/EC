<p>Thank you for supporting Eureka College Athletics by registering to play in the 2015 Eureka College Golf Outing.  I am excited to have you join us for a great day of golf at the Den at Fox Creek in Bloomington, Illinois.  Registration will begin at 12 noon with a shotgun start at 1:00 p.m.  Dinner, awards, and our auction will immediately follow at approximately 5:30 p.m.</p>

<p>Please note that this year's outing is at a new course, the Den at Fox Creek in Bloomington, Illinois.  An Arnold Palmer Signature Golf Course, the Den is a Scottish Links style golf course featuring over 130 sand traps, and water hazards on half of the holes.  It should be a great new challenge for the Eureka College Golf Outing.  

<p>I appreciate your support of this great event and, more importantly, our student-athletes.  The Den is located at 3002 Fox Creek Road in Bloomington, Illinois.  I look forward to seeing you on Friday, June 26 for a great day in support of Eureka College Red Devil Student-Athletes!
