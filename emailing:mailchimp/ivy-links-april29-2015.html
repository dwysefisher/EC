<p style="font-family:'Open Sans', Geneva, Arial, sans-serif;color:#3f4041;">Titled "What's in a Lie? Recognizing Deception," the presentation will discuss kinesics interviewing techniques that are used to determine deceitful answers by observing facial expressions, eye movement, body language and speech patterns. The techniques are based on the natural reactions a person has under the stress of lying, resulting in changes in their behavior.</p>

<p style="font-family:'Open Sans', Geneva, Arial, sans-serif;color:#3f4041;">Kristine A. Culp, <a href="http://ddh.uchicago.edu/contact/kculp.shtml" style="border-bottom: 1px dotted;text-decoration: none;color: #cc9900;font-weight: normal;">Dean of the Disciples Divinity House</a> of the University of Chicago, will give the sermon at the baccalaureate service at 6:30 p.m. Friday, May 15 in the Cerf Center. </p>

<p style="font-family:'Open Sans', Geneva, Arial, sans-serif;color:#3f4041;">Her sermon will be from Matthew 6:25-29, which asks, "Is life not more than food, and the body more than clothing?" Her remarks, titled "Glory," will invite graduates to "consider the lilies of the field" and how the graduates' own work and lives might bear glory.</p>

<p style="font-family:'Open Sans', Geneva, Arial, sans-serif;color:#3f4041;">She has been Dean of the Disciples Divinity House, which is one of the graduate theological education institutions of the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), since 1991. The institution offers a residential scholarship program in conjunction with the University of Chicago Divinity School and includes financial aid, educational programs and a community of faith and learning for students pursuing preparation for ministry and master's and doctoral degrees in religion. She was the first woman to become chief executive of one of the Disciples theological institutions nationwide.  </p>

<p style="font-family:'Open Sans', Geneva, Arial, sans-serif;color:#3f4041;">The leader of the Council of Independent College's <a href="http://www.liberalartspower.org/" style="border-bottom: 1px dotted;text-decoration: none;color: #cc9900;font-weight: normal;">Campaign for the Liberal Arts</a>, Dr. S. Georgia Nugent, will deliver the 160th commencement address at 10:30 a.m. Saturday, May 16 in Reagan Physical Education Center.</p>

<p style="font-family:'Open Sans', Geneva, Arial, sans-serif;color:#3f4041;">She will share a message about the advantages of a liberal arts education and Eureka College's history of equality of opportunity. </p>

<p style="font-family:'Open Sans', Geneva, Arial, sans-serif;color:#3f4041;">Her address will draw from the CIC's campaign, a multi-pronged initiative to promote the liberal arts and the effectiveness of independent higher education to increase the likelihood that the next generation of Americans will be prepared for the top-priority jobs in the United States and for leadership in a democratic society. </p>
