<p>Thanks, {Name (First):1.3}, for registering to participate in our Early Registration Day. Please keep this email for your records. The schedule for Early Registration Day can be <a href="http://www.eureka.edu/admissions/early-registration-schedule/">viewed here</a>.</p>

<p>Visit our <a href="http://www.eureka.edu/admissions/first-year-experience/">First Year Experience page</a> for more information about the programs you will experience during your freshman year at EC. Your next step will be to sign-up for a summer JUMPstart event. <a href="http://www.eureka.edu/admissions/orientation">Learn more about these next steps!</a></p>

<p>To give you and your advisor a head start on your first year course registration, prior to your arrival at Early Registration, the Office of the Registrar will pre-register you for a starter schedule of courses appropriate for your first year.  Some of these courses are required in the first year, like IDS101 (First Year Seminar) and ENG103W (Academic Writing and Research).  The rest will be selected from your major (if you have declared one) and from the General Education Curriculum. </p>

<p>While we provide you with a starter schedule, part of the appeal of a liberal arts curriculum is the measure of choice a student has in the courses they take.  Don't prefer some of the choices we've made for you in this starter schedule?  No worries.  You and your advisor can make changes and tailor your schedule according to your interests, but within the parameters of your degree requirements.</p>

<p><strong>Preparing for Your First Course Registration</strong></p>

<p>To have the best registration and advising experience possible, you can do some work ahead of time so that you arrive informed and having already considered some of the course choices you will have for your first year.  Here are a few tips for a great advising and registration session:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="http://www.eureka.edu/on-campus/registrar">Read the Academic Requirements and Policies section of the Eureka College Catalog</a>. Here you'll find, among other important things, the course requirements of the General Education Curriculum.  Some of these courses are required (like IDS101 and ENG103W), but in most of the Gen Ed curriculum you will have choices on which classes to take to meet requirements.  Note where these choices are, and begin thinking about which courses you'd like to take.  The Catalog also contains course descriptions, so read them carefully as you weigh your options.</li>

		<li>Read the Program Description for your Major.  The Catalog also contains program descriptions and course requirements for all the majors (and minors).  If you've decided upon a major, examine its curriculum carefully.  Reading the course descriptions and prerequisites, try to identify which courses are appropriate for first year students.</li>

		<li>Transfer Credit?  Have you taken any dual credit college courses?  Summer course at a community college?  Advanced Placement or CLEP exams?  Be sure to send us your official transcripts or test score reports as soon as you can.  Be sure to tell your advisor at Early Registration or Jump Start that you have transfer credit.  You don't want to register for a class for which you already have credit!</li>
