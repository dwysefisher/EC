<h3 class="fn"><a href="#">The Big Sleep</a></h3>
<div>
<p>The Big Sleep (1939) is a crime novel by Raymond Chandler, the first in his acclaimed series about hardboiled detective Philip Marlowe. The story is noted for its complexity and is heavily influenced by classic Greek tragedy, with many characters double-crossing each other and many secrets being exposed throughout the narrative. The title is a euphemism for death; it refers to a rumination in the book about &#8220;sleeping the big sleep&#8221;.</p>
<p>Private investigator Philip Marlowe is called to the sprawling mansion of the elderly and paraplegic General Sternwood. General Sternwood asks Marlowe to deal with a blackmailer named Arthur Gwynn Geiger.</p>

<h3 class="fn"><a href="#">The Long Goodbye</a></h3>
<div>
<p>The Long Good-bye is a 1953 novel by Raymond Chandler, centered on his famous detective Philip Marlowe. While some consider it not on the level of The Big Sleep or Farewell, My Lovely, others rank it as the best of his work. It is notable for using hard-boiled detective fiction as a vehicle for social criticism. It is also known for having autobiographical elements that relate to Chandler's life.</p>
<p>The novel opens outside a club called The Dancers. Marlowe, whom we presumably know from previous novels, meets a drunk named Terry Lennox, a man with scars on one side of his face. They forge an uneasy friendship over the next few months.</p>

<h3 class="fn"><a href="#">The Simple Art of Murder</a></h3>
<div>
<p>The Simple Art of Murder refers to both a critical essay and a collection of short stories written by hard-boiled detective fiction author Raymond Chandler. The essay was first published in The Atlantic Monthly in December 1944. It was reprinted in 1950 along with eight of Chandler&#8217;s early stories pre-dating his first novel, The Big Sleep.</p>
<p>The essay is considered a seminal piece of literary criticism. Although Chandler&#8217;s primary topic is the art (and failings) of detective fiction, he touches on general literature and modern society as well.</p>
