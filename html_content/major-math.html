<p class="first-paragraph">Mathematics, more than any other human endeavor, relies on deductive reasoning to produce new knowledge from the investigation of natural events, whether they occur in our immediate environment or in the immensity of space. It serves as a universal language which represents, interprets, and integrates all such knowledge.</p>

<p>The subject of mathematics is divided into algebra, geometry, analysis, and probability. Some of the concepts of each of these subdivisions are particularly useful in helping to discuss or solve problems in other fields. These concepts are frequently called Applied Mathematics.</p>
