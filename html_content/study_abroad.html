<p class="first-paragraph">Eureka College actively encourages students to take advantage of study abroad opportunities and has set aside financial support in the form of tuition grants to help students realize their dreams to foreign travel.</p>

<h3>Why study abroad?</h3>
Studying abroad gives students exposure to unique cultures and enhances their Eureka experience.

Students who have studied or interned abroad tell us that the experience helped them in gaining future employment, in providing direction for graduate school, and in expanding their knowledge and appreciation of the world.

And that's all without mentioning all the new people who are encountered and the sheer enjoyment that they experience!

<h3>Eureka College Study Abroad Program</h3>
<h4>Providing The Opportunities</h4>

Eureka College would like for at least 10% of our students to have an "out of country" experience during their years at the school, either through semester/summer study, internships, Sandifer Mentorships, Reagan Fellowships, choir trips, or service learning projects.

The Study Abroad Program strives to obtain various tuition grants for current students interested in international travel. All study abroad monies go through Eureka College. Students who participate in the program are responsible for a presentation about their time abroad. They are also required to provide service to the College or the community to help promote cultural awareness or studying abroad in general. Financially they are responsible for what the tuition grant is not able to fully cover.
