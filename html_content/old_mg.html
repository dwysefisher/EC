Dear Alumni,
Blessed...that is what I am. I have the pleasure every working day to connect with our alumni, a group of wonderful individuals that demonstrate "community" at its best. This concept went beyond my professional interactions to being very personal this month.  I often reach out to alumni regarding students looking for assistance as they maneuver through the college years.

This spring I reached out to the only Eureka College alumnus that lives in Ireland, Jerome Westbrooks '75 .  Jerome is  known as the "Michael Jordan of Ireland, "moving there after graduation from Eureka and playing professional basketball for several years. I reached out to Jerome regarding a student who was going to be in Ireland this summer on a Special Olympics internship. Sight unseen, Jerome and his wonderful wife Lois stepped up to a request to help this student get her bearings in a city that they call home.  They researched housing, picked her up from the airport, hosted her for dinner, introduced her to neighbors, friends, church folk and helped her navigate the public transportation system in a huge city of 1.5 million people.

Another alumnus and classmate of mine, Mike Kleppin, '87 was also in Ireland this summer, vacationing with his family. I connected with Mike on Facebook about this student. Mike and his family went the extra mile to take time out of their vacation plans to have dinner with this student, give her some moral support and a taste of home in a foreign land. Mike said that it was HIS pleasure and loved connecting with Eureka folk whenever he could.

These two alumni impacted this student's life greatly and gave great comfort to her parents who share the Eureka bond. You see, the student is my daughter, Lauren. I can tell you that it really touched my heart when they went above and beyond to reach out to Lauren, whom they had never met and helped her get her bearings, 6000 miles away from little Eureka, IL. Home is where the heart is, and when you are a part of the Eureka College family, Home is wherever Eureka Alumni are.
