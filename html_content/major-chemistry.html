The course of study in theatre arts and drama is generalist in nature since the discipline  itself demands a vast, well-rounded understanding of the history, literature, theory and practical applications of many art forms. The collaborative nature of theatre allows the student critical thinking skills, keen powers of observation and a true liberal arts preparation for advanced and graduate study in all areas of theatre as well as law, communications and ministerial work. The major also stresses overseas study and internships with major theatre groups, including our exclusive arrangement with major movie, television, and theatre producers.
