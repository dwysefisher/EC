<h4 class="first-line">Making a Difference</h4>

<p>Eureka College's core value of Stewardship and Sustainability emphasizes the commitment of the college to managing "our resources in ways that preserve both the college and our natural resources for future generations."</p>

<h4>Planning and Administration</h4>

<p>Mindful planning and support from administration and beyond is crucial to our success in sustainability.</p>

<p>The Sustainability Committee is dedicated to advising and facilitating sustainability improvement on campus. This group of stakeholders includes active students, faculty, staff, administration, and community members who enrich and enable sustainable development at Eureka College. One of the more recent projects involves the funding and development for <a href="http://www.usgbc.org/projects/eureka-college-sanders-hall">Sanders Hall LEED Certification</a>. </p>

<hr>

<h4>Academics</h4>

<p>Education facilitates and informs everything we do to become more sustainable. Learn more about our <a href="/academics/major-environmental-studies/">Environmental Studies major or minor</a> or take EVS classes for your general education credit.</p>

<h5>Get recognized for environmental leadership! </h5>

<p>Student Alliance for a Greener Environment (SAGE) was a finalist for the <a href="http://www.aashe.org/highlights/press-releases/campus-sustainability-leaders-take-center-stage-aashe-2013">2013 Student Sustainability Leadership Award</a>, given by The Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education (AASHE).</p>

<p>Sanders Hall is the first building on the Eureka campus and in Woodford County to earn <a href="http://www.eureka.edu/news/sanders-hall-leed-certification/">LEED certification</a>.</p>

<h4>Community Engagement &ndash; help make a difference one step at a time. </h4>

<h5>Success stories</h5>

<p>In the past five years, students have taken part in unique projects around the Eureka College campus and in the Eureka community. These include: </p>

<p>Working with staff and faculty members to gather data about campus sustainability indicators and to provide Eureka College management with a preliminary campus sustainability assessment.</p>

<p>Working with the City of Eureka and staff at ADDWC (Association for the Developmentally Disabled in Woodford County), a local recycling facility, to develop a survey to research recycling in the community.</p>

<p>Getting a sign posted on Rt. 117 in Eureka to point to the direction of the local recycling center by communicating with the Illinois Department of Transportation.</p>

<p>Partnering with ADDWC and Eureka High School's environmental club on electronic recycling awareness. This led to a successful day of electronic recycling. </p>
	
<p>Changing and improving the lighting in Reagan Gym, as this one room contains hundreds of lightbulbs. This resulted in a quick return on investment and energy savings for years to come. </p>

<p>Researching which species of plants to plant in the landscaping around the new addition, Sanders Hall. These plants needed to be native, aesthetically pleasing, and help absorb and retain any stormwater that runs off the building. This allows it to soak into the ground to replenish the groundwater supply as opposed to running into the sewer system. </p>

<h4>Operations</h4>

<p>Investing in sustainable infrastructure makes campus more efficient day by day. </p>
