<h3 class="first-line">Making a Difference</h3>

	<p>Eureka College's core value of Stewardship and Sustainability emphasizes the commitment of the college to managing &ldquo;<em>our resources in ways that preserve both the college and our natural resources for future generations</em>.&rdquo; During the Spring semester of 2011, five students participated in a new service learning course, &ldquo;Assessing Sustainability on the EC Campus.&rdquo; The students worked with staff and faculty members to gather data about campus sustainability indicators and to provide Eureka College management with a preliminary campus sustainability assessment.</p>

<h4>Indicators of Sustainability at EC</h4>

	<p><em>Benefits of recycling efforts</em></p>
	<p><em>Benefits of lighting efforts</em></p>
	<p><em>Benefits of energy-saving efforts</em></p>
		<p>For the boiler systems, we now have control over occupied/non occupied settings, to make better use of when the energy is used. DDC controls also help target troubleshooting areas. Geothermal systems take advantage of the earth's temperature to create a consistent environment.</p>

<h3>Sustainability on campus</h3>

	<p>The Spring 2014 Botany class is doing research and experiments to decide which species of plants to plant in the landscaping around the new addition, <a href="http://www.eureka.edu/giving/sanders-hall">Sanders Hall</a>. The main objectives in choosing the plants are that they will be native, aesthetically pleasing, and they will help to absorb and retain any storm water that runs off the building allowing it to soak into the ground to replenish the ground water supply as opposed to running into the sewer system.  All in order gain points for LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certification!</p>

<h3>Sustainability in the community</h3>

	<p>With the help of the City of Eureka, psychology professor Ann Fulop, and staff at ADDWC (Association for the Developmentally Disabled in Woodford County), a local recycling facility, EC students developed a survey to research recycling in the community. They passed the survey out to a random selection of residents in the City of Eureka to see what the communities' stance on recycling was. As it turned out a lot of people didn't even know there was a recycling center in Eureka!</p>
	
	<p>In the Spring of 2013 students decided to continue this project and assisted ADDWC and IDOT with getting a sign posted on Rt. 117 in Eureka to point to the direction of the local recycling center.  The class also worked with ADDWC and Eureka High School's environmental club on electronic recycling awareness.  This led to a successful day of electronic recycling at a music festival held by Eureka College's environmental club (SAGE). By working with all of the different stakeholders in regard to waste management and recycling, these examples demonstrate EC's efforts build stronger relationships within the community.</p>
