<p>Eureka College has so much to offer its students. Here are the top five reasons why you should apply to Eureka College.</p>

<h4>1. We're a tight-knit college community.</h4>

	<p>As a small liberal arts college, everyone gets to know everyone pretty quickly. You will get to know your professors on a personal basis. They'll know your strengths and weaknesses and help you grow to your full potential. You'll be able to talk to them outside of class, whether at office hours, or during lunch at the Commons. The faculty and staff are always there to assist you with anything you need.</p>

<h4>2. Limitless ways to get involved.</h4>

	<p>If you find it hard to believe that a college of 700 students could have so many opportunities, then you haven't visited Eureka College. We have scholarships, mentorships and study abroad programs to help students gain experience in their fields. The <a href="http://www.eureka.edu/reagan/reagan-leadership-program/">Reagan Leadership Program</a> and <a href="http://www.eureka.edu/admissions/sandifer-mentorships/">Sandifer Mentorships</a> are two examples of huge opportunities at Eureka College. There are also numerous opportunities to serve in a leadership role or to serve your community.</p>

<h4>3. There is something for everyone. </h4>
	<p>Athlete? Musician? Artist? Gamer? There is literally something for everyone here at EC. We are Division III for athletics and offer a variety in both men's and women's sports. Join the chorale, band or theatre if you're musical. Illustrate your own children's book, or start your own gaming-get-together with your friends. Not only is there something for everyone, but on that off-chance Eureka doesn't have what you're looking for, you could start your own organization!</p>
	
<h4>4. Our college is rich in history. </h4>
	<p>From being founded by a group of Kentucky abolitionists in 1855 to graduating a President of the United States (Ronald Reagan), Eureka College is rich in history. Did you know Abraham Lincoln spoke at Eureka College? Did you also know that before Melick Library became the library, it was a fallout shelter. In 2009, Mikhail Gorbachev visited Eureka College and Sandra Day O'Connor visited in 2013. </p>
	
<h4>5. Small-town charm, big opportunities. </h4>
	<p>Eureka College is nestled in the middle of a small town and it's about a 7-minute walk from one end to the next. It's just a short drive/walk to get groceries, or to the nearest restaurant. The park is also close by where you can play disc golf, recreational games for baseball and basketball, or walk the trails. We are also in between Peoria and Bloomington where you can find even more activities.</p>
