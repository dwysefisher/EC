Hello, friends of Eureka College and prospective students! I'm so pleased that you've made the trip all around this great big world (wide web) and found yourself in our little EC nook.

Allow me to introduce myself. I'm Dr. Emily Eaton, assistant professor of Spanish. Some of our readers may remember me&mdash;or my mom&mdash;from my <a href="https://eurekacollegehumanities.wordpress.com/2014/11/07/whos-smarter-than-your-professor-her-mom/">first-ever blog post</a> in 2014. Not only was the post read by SEVERAL of my humanities colleagues, it also received a user comment.  The comment was from my uncle, but I still think that's pretty impressive for a first try. After its wild success, I put my blogging days behind meâ€”as it turns out, I'm just not cut out to be both an internet superstar AND a classroom one. 

But now I'm back! I just couldn't resist when the folks in admissions contacted me with a special request: to contribute to the new Eureka College blog.  Negotiations began when they mentioned there would be a word limit. They told me the post couldn't be more than 500 words.  After I made a very reasonable counter-offer of 30,000, we split the difference and settled on 700.

With our first post, let's cover the sorts of things you can do and what you can learn at Eureka. Here are some of highlights from this semester:

<strong>Forensic Files and Criminal Investigation</strong>
Dr. Bill Lally will teach you to analyze a crime scene. And it's even better than Forensic Files. If you've ever watched that masterful, hopelessly addictive program, then you know that my praise should not be taken lightly. 

<strong>S'mores and Poetry</strong>
In Doc Whitson's poetry workshop, you will eat s'mores. Seriously! She took her students for an overnight at the campus library, where they ate S'MORES and also read poetry. (Or maybe it was read poetry and also ate s'mores? I can't remember which activity was the main priority.)

<strong>Fun with Math</strong>
In Real Analysis with math professor Prabhu Venkataraman&mdash;whose seminar in Fake Analysis never really took off the way he'd hoped&mdash;you will learn about something called "differentiable real-valued functions." I mean, obviously I know what those are, but if you want to know what they are, you'll just have to take the class. 

<strong>Mild Self-Deprecation and Creative Nonfiction</strong>
In our creative nonfiction class taught by Dr. Zeke Jarvis, you'll develop your writing style. I bet he'll even teach you how to appropriately inject humor and mild self-deprecation into your creative work. You'll work with genres such as memoir, personal essays, and journalism, and I'm pretty sure that I'll be invited to do a unit on blogging any day now.

Anyway, I'm almost at my 700 words here and need to wrap it up. But, wait, I still haven't told you what I'm doing in class this semester! As luck would have it, I'm teaching a senior-level class where my students have been reflecting on the value of college in general and Eureka more specifically. I've asked them to think about why they chose EC and how they've been transformed by classes and teachers like those mentioned above. Best of all, a few of my students are going to share their thoughts with you right here in the coming months.
