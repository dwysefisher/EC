<p class="first-paragraph">Answers to some of the commonly asked questions about living on campus.</p>

<h4>Selecting a Roommate</h4>
<p>Aside from Langston Hall, a majority of rooms on campus are double occupancy rooms that students share with a roommate.  Although we cannot provide a private room for all students interested, students should specify on their housing contract if they are interested in paying the additional cost to have their own room. </p>

<p>Room assignments and roommate/suitemate assignments are made based on the date that the students' housing contract and refundable housing deposit ($100) are received.  While there is no guarantee of residence hall, we will give priority to the housing contracts and deposits received before April 1, 2015 based on the date we receive them.  If you have yet to tour our Residence Halls on campus and would like to do so, please contact our Admissions Office to set up an appointment!</p>

<p>Students may request to have a specific roommate, but should do so before June 1 for the upcoming fall semester.  This request will be honored as long as both students specify on their contract that they are interested in living together before June 1.  If a student does not request a specific roommate/suitemate, they will be paired based on their completed roommate survey.  Formal notice of all room and roommate/suitemate assignments will be mailed out in mid-July for the upcoming fall semester.  Eureka College attempts to respond to each and every request.</p>  

<p>Students interested in switching rooms/roommates must talk with their RA and the Director of Residence Life.  No room changes will be granted during the first two weeks of the semester.</p>

<h4>What Is An RA?</h4>

<p>Resident Advisors (RA's) are student members of the Residence Life Staff who live on the floors in the residence halls.  An RA is assigned to each floor.  This person is a student's initial contact whenever there are questions or concerns.  Our student to RA ratio is 18:1 which helps us to be very visible and accessible to residents.  The RA is also responsible for building community, planning programs, explaining and enforcing policies, mediating roommate conflicts, handling concerns, and being a friend or big "brother/sister" to the residents on their floor.</p>

<h4>What Should I Bring?</h4>

<p>There is a link to a <a href="http://www.eureka.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Packing-List.pdf" alt="Suggested Packing List">suggested packing list</a> available, which you will also receive when you come to a <a href="http://www.eureka.edu/admissions/jump-start/">Jump Start</a> or <a href="http://www.eureka.edu/admissions/transfermation/">TRANSFERmation</a> session over the summer.  Please keep in mind that the following items are not permitted in the residence halls: AC window units/space heaters, Foreman-style grills, open coiled cooking instruments, toasters/toaster ovens, water beds, halogen lamps, BB guns/air guns/paintball guns, knives (larger than a pocket knife), alcohol/drug paraphernalia, alcohol can/bottle collections, or pets (other than fish/10 gallon tank or less)!</p>

<p>Students are welcome to bring bikes, but are encouraged to bring a lock to secure it to one of several outdoor bike racks located throughout campus.  Bikes are not permitted in the residence halls, unless they are kept inside a student's room.  </p>

<p>Several outdoor grills are available on campus surrounding the residence halls and are available for student use at any time.  Students are responsible for bringing their own supplies and cleaning up the area after they have finished.  </p>

<h4>Campus Mail</h4>

<p>All residential students have a campus mailbox located in the Cerf Center.  (Ivy Hall residents have a mailbox located in Ivy Hall.)  Commuter students are offered a campus mailbox on a first come, first serve basis.  Students are encouraged to check their mail at least once per day as faculty, staff, and students utilize campus mailboxes for distribution of notices, letters, and announcements.  </p>

<p>All students have the same campus mailing address, but with a specific box # that they will receive after they move in.  All mail can be addressed to:</p>

<b>Student's Name<br />
Eureka College<br />
300 E. College Ave. Box #______<br />
Eureka, IL  61530</b>

<h4>Can I Decorate My Room?</h4>

<p>Residents are encouraged to decorate individual rooms to their liking. However, wallpaper and contact paper should not be used and students are not allowed to paint their rooms. Residents should also refrain from using nails, screws, and duct tape which cause lasting damage to the walls.  We strongly encourage residents to use putty and command strips to hang pictures and posters on the walls.</p>  

<h4>Is Storage Available?</h4>

<p>Eureka College does not offer storage space for residential students.  Residents wishing to store belongings during the year or over the summer are encouraged to call a local storage facility in Eureka or the surrounding area.  </p>

<h4>Can I Bring A Car?</h4>

<p>Currently, all residential students are welcome to bring a car to campus and register for a parking permit.  Although many residential students may enjoy having a car on campus, it is not a necessity.  All residential and commuter students wishing to bring a car must be sure to complete the Parking Registration Form.  This form should be completed before the first day of class in order to avoid receiving a parking ticket.  Residential students and commuter students each have designated parking lots that they must park in.  More information about specific parking lots is given out after a student registers for their parking permit.  There is not an additional charge to register for and receive a parking permit.</p>
