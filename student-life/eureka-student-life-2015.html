<p class="first-paragraph">At Eureka, education is a total experience of living and learning, combining academic responsibilities with programs outside the classroom. The College community is dedicated to providing quality growth experiences which enhance the development of the student as an informed, contributing member of society. Many activities outside the classroom are available at Eureka, and students are encouraged to participate in those which will best complement their educational experiences.</p>

<p>Eureka College assumes the mature and responsible citizenship of its students. The College believes this citizenship is best realized through personal freedom of each individual, as well as the community building efforts of students, faculty and staff. College standards recognize that duties and responsibilities go with freedom to insure that rights of the College and those of students thrive in an environment of learning and personal growth. Students assume an obligation to conduct themselves in a manner compatible with the purpose and principles of the College. Student behavior should be such that concern for other persons is displayed. At a minimal level this means that no conduct on the part of any individual or group should cause harm to others or seriously inconvenience others. At a more mature level, the principle of concern for others means thoughtful and helpful behavior toward other persons. In any community setting, it is necessary to agree on boundaries within which individual behavior is acceptable.</p>

<p>General regulations governing student life are <a href="http://www.eureka.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Final-Handbook-2014-2015.pdf" target="_blank">found in the Student Handbook</a>. Enrollment at Eureka College is considered an implicit declaration of acceptance on the part of the student of College regulations, both academic and social. College regulations support local, state and Federal laws and are in compliance with the Drug-Free Community and Schools Act of 1989, the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988, and the Campus Security Act of 1990.</p>

<h3>Letter from the Student Body President</h3>

<p>To the Eureka College Community,</p> 

<p>My name is Colton Lott and I will be serving you this academic year as the Student Body President.  As we look forward to the 2014&ndash;2015 year, I would invite all members to reflect deeply on what "it" is that you have found here at Eureka College.  Like many, I have found friends that feel like family, caring and supportive staff, many mentoring relationships, the opportunity to be taught by some of the world's best faculty, and so many things far too numerous and wonderful to list.</p>

<p>To those of you joining our community for the first time, I invite you to discover learning through the classroom and in your daily responsibilities and interactions.  I invite you to discover service both here on campus and within our historic city.  I invite you to discover leadership, both the overt and public role and also the role of the servant-leader.  Finally, I highly encourage you to not leave this place without having begun the work of discovering your own self.</p>

<p>As we look to 160 years toward equal opportunity, it is important to not only look forward to our current year, but also to remember the call that the founders of Eureka College gave to each of us.  Started by abolitionists, Eureka was committed to be an institution for compassionate radicals, just as they were in their own time.  With a deep belief that higher education had a higher purpose, they leave us an astounding legacy of which we are the contemporary fulfillment.</p>

<p>As always, feel free to contact me or any student senator at any time with your concerns or your vision for what tomorrow could look like.  The Student Senate of Eureka College is your designated vehicle for those changes.  Furthermore, our weekly meetings are Wednesday night at 6:30 pm in the Terrill rooms and the public is always invited and highly encouraged to attend.</p>

<p>Yours 'neath the elms,<br />
Colton Lott<br />
Student Body President</p>
