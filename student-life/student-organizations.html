Eureka College offers part time employment opportunities for our students. There are a finite number of positions available and Eureka wishes to expand these opportunities across the greatest number of eligible students. To accomplish this goal, students generally are not allowed to hold two part-time positions simultaneously. Certain positions require experience or special skill which warrants an exception to this policy. In these cases the hiring supervisor must provide the Human Resources Office with written justification of the need to award the student an additional job. An exception to this requirement exists for students that work for Sodexo. Sodexo is a separate entity from Eureka College and a supplier of EC services.<p></p>
<p>A student must initiate a request for a job interview through the Human Resources office by obtaining an Interview Authorization Slip.</p>
<p>A work study award does not guarantee availability of a job or that the student will earn the total award. Paychecks are distributed every two weeks for hours actually worked.</p>
<p>Students must complete an I-9 Employment Eligibility form, provide original documents to verify Employment Eligibility, and complete State and Federal W-4 tax withholding forms before they can begin working on campus.</p>

<h3>Greek Life</h3>

<p>Eureka College has six organizations that make up the Greek community. Four of these organizations are recognized nationally, which means these groups have multiple chapters represented across the nation at various colleges and universities, including their chapter here at Eureka.  Two organizations are local chapters which means they were founded here at Eureka College and are represented only at Eureka.</p>

<p>The six Greek organizations are made up of three fraternities; Delta Sigma Phi, Lambda Chi Alpha, and Tau Kappa Epsilon, and three sororities; Delta Delta Pi, Delta Zeta, and Phi Omega. All of these chapters are a part of the Greek Council, which is a group whose purpose is to develop and maintain Greek Life and community relations at the highest level of accomplishment both on campus and within the greater community. These organizations, as part of the Greek Council, are guided by six core values; community, diversity, excellence, leadership, scholarship, and service. Fraternity and Sorority Recruitment occur twice a year, once at the beginning of the fall semester for upper-class and transfer students, and once at the beginning of the spring semester for freshman, upper-class, and transfer students.</p>

<p>These organizations are very active on campus, participating in campus events such as Homecoming, Greek Week, Parent’s Day, and Alumni Weekend.  Members of these organizations donate their time as well as raise money for the American Red Cross, St. Jude, March of Dimes, and Susan G. Komen, in addition to numerous local charities and foundations.</p>

<p>Currently, Eureka College has four organizations living on-campus in campus owned housing, and two organizations that own their own houses off-campus (but within close proximity to campus).  Residential students who choose to join a Greek organization are required to live with their designated Greek organization, if they are in campus owned housing, beginning the fall semester following their initiation.</p>
