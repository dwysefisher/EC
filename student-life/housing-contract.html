<div class="font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;">
<p>On this the day, Eureka College "the college" and the undersigned by and/or on behalf of the student/Resident (hereinafter the "student" even if executing as a representative of the student), hereby enter into this Housing Services Contract upon the following terms and conditions. The student understands that the college will not permit the student to occupy a room without the student's express agreement to all terms and conditions listed as part of this Contract.</p>

<h4>1. Application Process</h4>

<p><em>Housing Services Contracts</em> must be filed in the student Programs and Services (SPS) Office.  students submitting the Housing Services Contract by the published deadline will qualify for a double or single space in College housing only if adequate space is available and if in the college's sole opinion, it is the best match with the student's indicated preferences.</p>

<p><em>Commitment Deposit:</em>  A refundable housing deposit of $100 is required, of all new students, and once deposited, it will be held as a security deposit. students are not permitted to move in until this deposit has been paid.  This is a one-time deposit and does not need to be paid each year.  Unless other charges apply, the deposit will be returned to the student upon graduation or withdrawal from the college, provided there are no outstanding charges on the student's Account. Also, students who move off campus without obtaining prior written approval from the student Programs and Services (SPS) Office will forfeit this deposit and could also not be eligible for a refund of room fees.</p>  

<p><strong>Though new students are strongly encouraged to submit a completed Housing Services Contract by June 1, 2016, priority will be given to those who submit both the Housing Services Contract AND $100 housing deposit by April 1, 2016.</strong>  This will allow the Director of Residence Life to best attempt to meet their housing assignment requests. </p>

<hr>

<p>The following are express provisions of this Housing Services Contract:</p>
<ul class="body-list">
	<li>No assignment will be made without a Housing Services Contract signed by and/or on behalf of the student and the $100 housing deposit on file with the student Programs and Services (SPS) Office.  </li>

	<li>The student is applying for an assignment within the residence hall system and not for any one specific space.</li>
	
	<li>In the event of full occupancy, the college will assign students to temporary housing.  students will if so requested by the college, be required to vacate temporary spaces when permanent housing becomes available.  The student Programs and Services (SPS) Office will attempt to minimize any disruption to the students involved.</li>
	
	<li>If the student arrives late or leaves early, or is required to leave the college for any reason, the student could remain financially bound by the terms and conditions of this contract (except as explicitly otherwise provided in this document as outlined in Section 6).</li>
	
	<li>The student is requesting that the college enter into this Contract. The student accepts responsibility to pay all resultant charges for these services, even if he/she does not make use of some or all of the services noted.  the college agrees to faithfully provide those services unless events beyond its control prevent its so doing. </li>
	</ul>
	

<h4>2.  Terms and Eligibility</h4>

	<p>This Contract is for the Fall 2016 and Spring 2017 semesters. Eligibility is limited to Eureka College students.  Full-time students will be given priority; part-time status students may be allowed to retain eligibility for on campus living on a space available basis only.  Non-students are not permitted to live in the residence halls.</p>

<h4>3.  Period of occupancy</h4>
	<p>The student may occupy an assigned room each semester at the time published by the student Programs and Services (SPS) Office.  Failure to occupy the room by 5:00 p.m. on the first day of classes may result in assignment of the room to another student.  If the student fails to occupy space, or removes all of his/her belongings during the course of the semester, the assignment will be considered abandoned and could be reassigned to another student. Occupancy of the room must be terminated at the completion of this Housing Services Contract (by the published residence hall closing date). College housing and dining facilities are closed during Thanksgiving, Winter, and Spring Breaks.  Entry to Residence Halls is prohibited when buildings are closed, unless prior written approval has been granted by the Director of Residence Life.</p>

	<p><strong>Notice of Early Arrival and Late Departure Charges:</strong>  If you occupy before, or fail to vacate your room by, the published dates the residence halls are officially open or closed without the prior written approval from the Director of Residence Life, you will be assessed a fine in addition to a charge per day that you stay.  Appropriate disciplinary action may also be invoked.</p>

	<p><strong>Breaks:</strong> If you need to stay on campus during an official break due to an on or off campus job, College Athletics, or because you live too far to go home, you may request permission to stay.  If approved, you may be charged $10 per night, depending on your reasoning for staying.</p>

<h4>4.  Board</h4>
	<p>All students with full time status residing in the Residence Halls are required to purchase a Board Plan.</p>

<h4>5.  Refunds</h4>
	<p>Students are entitled to a prorated refund based on the college's tuition and refund policy upon withdrawal from the college.  Once a student has completed 60 percent or more of the semester, there are no refunds for room and board upon withdrawing.  </p>

	<ul class="body-list">
		<li>Students who are suspended from the college and/or the residence halls for disciplinary reasons may not be entitled to a refund of room fees for the amount of time that they will not be living on campus.  The student may still be financially responsible for the stipulated period on the contract.</li>
		<li>Students who vacate the residence halls but remain registered for any courses will be charged for the Contract until they have removed their belongings from their room AND have officially exited from the college (assuming both are completed before 60 percent of the semester has passed).</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Submit all written requests for cancellation to the Director of Residence Life.  Cancellations of the Housing Services Contract will be confirmed or denied in writing within ten business days of receipt of your request.  <strong>Please note that vacating the premises does not release the student from contractual obligations.</strong> In order to be approved for possible Housing Services Contract cancellations, you must meet one of the following criteria, as well as provide 2 weeks notice.</p>

	<ul class="body-list">
		<li>The college reserves the right to change room assignments at its discretion, including but not limited to, consolidation of room assignments.</li>
		<li>Students must occupy the room in which they are assigned.  Any change in room assignment must have prior approval from the Director of Residence Life.  students involved in unauthorized room changes will be assessed a fine and be subject to disciplinary action.  </li>
		<li>If you are in a living space and a vacancy occurs, you must accept a new occupant as assigned by the Director of Residence Life.  Behavior that is in violation of Eureka College's Rules and Policies or which unreasonably impedes an interested student or assigned occupant will be considered sufficient grounds for disciplinary action, which could include reassignment or removal from the residence halls, without refund, as determined by the Dean of students or his/her designee.  If you are living in a double occupancy room without a roommate, but not paying the single room rate, then you could receive a roommate at any time throughout the semester.</li>
		<li>Students involved in a roommate conflict will not be granted a room switch within the first two weeks of the semester, unless there is a health/safety risk present.  students wishing to apply for a room switch should meet with the Director of Residence Life to obtain more information on the college's room switch procedures.  </li>

	</ul>
	
<p>The student Programs and Services Office reserves the right to consolidate space/vacancies in order to accommodate any student or to close a hall or wing that is not full.  In the event of increased housing demand, the occupancy of certain designated single and double rooms may be increased.  students in these situations will be provided with an appropriate credit for a portion of the semester's room rate.  Assignments made for increases in occupancy will receive priority for relocation to regular assignments, as vacancies occur.  Also, in the event of over enrollment, first-year students may be assigned to upperclass areas.</p>

<h4>8. Liability</h4>
 	<p>The college shall not in any event be liable for the loss of, damage to, or theft of, any and all property belonging to the student. Further, the college shall not be liable for any claims for damage by reason of any injury or injuries to any persons, or damage to property which in any way arises out of the use and occupancy of the on-campus housing. The student hereby agrees to hold the college harmless from all liabilities on account of or by reason of any such injuries, liabilities, claims, suits or losses. The student shall be responsible for obtaining insurance coverage on her/his personal property.</p>
