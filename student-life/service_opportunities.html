<title>Service Opportunities</title>

<p>Did you know that Eureka College’s mission statement affirms a commitment to learning, service,and leadership? We believe that learning inside and outside the classroom, being a leader on campus and in your community, and giving back through service can significantly enrich your educational experience.</p>

<p>As a student at Eureka College, you will have many opportunities to be engaged in service experiences during your college career - All new students take part in a service project during the fall Welcome Week program and students in the First Year Seminar course are involved in a service-learning project as part of this class experience. The College also offers recognized student organizations whose primary focus is community service and sponsors various programs including Spring Break mission trips and days of service. We hope you will seek out ways to serve others through service-learning experiences and service opportunities in campus organizations, and projects which have a specific focus on helping a cause or making an impact on an area of need.</p>

<h3>Eureka College community service documentation process for students</h3>
The information collected through the College documentation process will be utilized for reporting, assessment/evaluation, and feedback purposes at the College. Your response provides us with important details to help us evaluate our efforts in striving for excellence in service.  Thank you for helping us collect this valuable information. 

<h4>What qualifies as community service for documentation process?</h4>
	<ol>
		<li>Direct service which benefits a non-profit/community based organization or those in need in the community (example: working directly with clients being served by an organization, such as mentoring/tutoring children or serving meals at a shelter).</li> 
		<li>Indirect service benefiting the greater good of the community (example: packing care packages for soldiers or collecting canned food items for a shelter or food pantry).</li>
		<li>Fundraising/Philanthropic work for non-profit community organizations.</li>
		<li>Some on-campus service activities (example: campus clean-up days, volunteering to raise funds for scholarships, volunteer classroom note taker).</li>
	<ol>

<h4>Documentation guidelines for students</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Please help us avoid duplication of service documentation.  If an individual is being included on a group form, it is not necessary for an individual service documentation form to be submitted. </li> 
		<li>For service hours to be counted towards a particular semester, the documentation must be completed and submitted by the last day of that respective semester.</li>
		<li>Students may submit service hours to be documented for summer volunteer work upon beginning their coursework at the College.</li>
		<li>For service work to be counted/documented, complete contact information from the person submitting and the site/organization being served must be included.</li>
		<li>While students are encouraged to pursue off-campus service opportunities as much as possible, there are some on-campus service projects that may be included in our documentation process. 
			<ul>
				<li>If it is part of an organization such as EC CARES, Student Foundation, Circle K, etc., count the hours you are actually volunteering at an event (writing donation letters, working the concession stand, participating in a campus clean-up), but typically not hours involved in planning and organizing for these types of events.</li>
				<li>Be sure to complete the appropriate paperwork - general risk waiver forms are always required for participants to complete when going anywhere off campus to serve.</li> 
				<li>When traveling outside of the City of Eureka, campus organizations/groups are required to complete the Group Travel Form, and all members are required to complete or have on file in Student Programs and Services Office, the travel/medical release forms (these forms are good for one year).</li>
			</ul>
		<li>While students are challenged to be intentional about their service activities, please know that we are seeking brief responses for goals/reflection fields on the documentation form.  If any of the fields do not apply, you may note N/A or not applicable.</li> 
		<li>Students documenting service hours for campus opportunities, scholarships, Sandifer Fellowship, etc., should also be recording and keeping their own service records. The information collected through College’s service documentation process may be used as reference, but does not suffice as evidence of students’ service involvement.</li>
