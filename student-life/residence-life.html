<h3 class="first-line">Welcome to EC Residence Life</h3>

Choosing to live on campus may be one of the best decisions a student can make as we strongly believe that the "out of classroom" learning experience is a significant part of a college education!  We highly recommend that all students take advantage of this incredible opportunity.  Residence halls are more than just dorms or places to eat and sleep.  Living on campus provides great opportunities for students to develop meaningful friendships and get involved with campus programming, organizations, and the overall college community. For the 2014-2015 academic year, 87% of our first year freshmen lived on campus.  

<p>Our incoming students for Fall 2015 will be part of the second class of students that will be offered a $1000 grant awarded to all full-time students who choose to live on campus!  We are excited to be able to offer this opportunity to incoming students as Eureka College strongly believes that students are best able to take advantage of the full Eureka College experience by living on campus.  We opened a brand new residence hall, Ivy Hall, in January 2012 and have also recently completed an extensive series of renovations on our existing residence halls.  It's a great time to join our residential community!</p>

<p><b>To reserve your space in campus housing, please return a <a href="http://www.eureka.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Housing-Contract-1415.pdf" alt="Housing Services Contract">Housing Services Contract</a> (will be mailed to you shortly after your acceptance to EC) along with a $100 refundable housing deposit.</b></p>

<p>While there is no guarantee of residence hall, we will give priority to the housing contracts and deposits received before April 1, 2015 based on the date that we receive them.  The deadline to request a specific roommate is June 1, 2015 for the fall semester.</p>

<h4>Housing and Residence Life Mission Statement</h4>

The Housing and Residence Life Department provides a safe, supportive, and comfortable living and learning environment that supports the mission of Eureka College.  The Residence Life Staff maintains a high standard of commitment and service in order to meet the diverse needs of our residents.  We work in collaboration with other campus educators to create a greater sense of community and atmosphere of tolerance, appreciation, and respect.  Through co-curricular programming, residents are empowered to achieve maximum success in academics, leadership, and campus and community involvement.  

<hr class="hr-style">

<h4>Themed Living-Learning Communities</h4>

Eureka College’s Themed Living-Learning Communities give students a unique, inclusive residential learning experience that connects classroom learning with residence life.  Students enjoy all of the usual advantages of living on campus in a residence hall, with the added benefit of living among a group that shares academic goals and another common interest. 

Through student, faculty, and staff partnerships, and educational and cultural programs, active involvement in a Themed Living-Learning Community allows you to broaden your perspectives and understanding of the world around you.  This holistic approach complements classroom experiences and lays the foundation for you to become better prepared to succeed in life beyond college. <a href="http://www.eureka.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Themed-Living-Learning.pdf" alt="Themed Living Learning Application">Applications</a> are now available for current students to submit proposals for Themed Living-Learning Communities for the 2014-2015 academic year.

<h3>Selecting a Roommate</h3>
Aside from Langston Hall, a majority of rooms on campus are double occupancy rooms that students share with a roommate.  Although we cannot provide a private room for all students interested, students should specify on their housing contract if they are interested in paying the additional cost to have their own room.  

Room assignments and roommate/suitemate assignments are made based on the date that the students’ housing contract and refundable housing deposit ($100) are received.  While there is no guarantee of residence hall, we will give priority to the housing contracts and deposits received before April 1, 2015 based on the date we receive them.  If you have yet to tour our Residence Halls on campus and would like to do so, please contact our Admissions Office to set up an appointment!

Students may request to have a specific roommate, but should do so before June 1 for the upcoming fall semester.  This request will be honored as long as both students specify on their contract that they are interested in living together before June 1.  If a student does not request a specific roommate/suitemate, they will be paired based on their completed roommate survey.  Formal notice of all room and roommate/suitemate assignments will be mailed out in mid-July for the upcoming fall semester.  Eureka College attempts to respond to each and every request.  

Students interested in switching rooms/roommates must talk with their RA and the Director of Residence Life.  No room changes will be granted during the first two weeks of the semester.

<a id="policies"></a>

<h3>Residence Hall policies I need to be aware of are:</h3>
<ul class="body-list no-bullet">
	<li>The State of Illinois law provides that any person less than 21 years of age who attempts to purchase, possess, consume, or transport any alcoholic beverages within Illinois is subject to fine or imprisonment or both.  The College does not condone violation of the law with respect to underage drinking.  Eureka College’s full alcohol and other drug policy may be located in the <a href="http://www.eureka.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Final-Handbook-2014-2015.pdf" target="_blank" class="underline">Student Handbook </a>.</li>
	<li>All Eureka College residence halls are non-smoking. Those wishing to smoke must do so outside and at least 15 feet away from any entrance. Smoking receptacles are located near most halls on campus.</li>
	<li>If there is any damage or vandalism done in the residence halls on campus and the College cannot identify responsible individuals, the College may require that all of the residents of that floor and/or building pay a prorated group charge to cover the cost of the damage.</li>
	<li>Students are not allowed to burn candles or incense in their rooms.</li>
	<li>Guests and friends of residents are welcome on campus at any time. Residents wishing to have a guest over MUST have the consent of their roommate beforehand. Residents wishing to have a guest stay for more than three consecutive nights must have prior approval from Residence Life.  Students are responsible for the actions of their guest if the guest is not a student of Eureka College.</li>
	<li>Eureka College upholds "quiet hours" on every residence hall floor on campus from 11pm until 7am.  During this time, residents must keep music and all other noise to a minimum. "Courtesy hours" exist 24 hours a day. Therefore, residents must be respectful towards their neighbors, in regards to noise, at all times.</li>
	<li>There are no pets permitted in the residence halls, with the exception of fish, which must be kept in a 10 gallon tank or less. </li>
	<li>More information on residential policies may be accessed through the <a href="http://www.eureka.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Final-Handbook-2014-2015.pdf" target="_blank" class="underline">Student Handbook</a>.</li>

<hr class="hr-style">

<h3>FAQs</h3>
<em>What Is An RA?</em>

Resident Advisors (RA’s) are student members of the Residence Life Staff who live on the floors in the residence halls.  An RA is assigned to each floor.  This person is a student’s initial contact whenever there are questions or concerns.  Our student to RA ratio is 18:1 which helps us to be very visible and accessible to residents.  The RA is also responsible for building community, planning programs, explaining and enforcing policies, mediating roommate conflicts, handling concerns, and being a friend or big “brother/sister” to the residents on their floor.

<em>What Should I Bring?</em>

There is a link to a <a href="http://www.eureka.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Packing-List.pdf" alt="Suggested Packing List">suggested packing list</a> available, which you will also receive when you come to a <a href="http://www.eureka.edu/admissions/jump-start/">Jump Start</a> or <a href="http://www.eureka.edu/admissions/transfermation/">TRANSFERmation</a> session over the summer.  Please keep in mind that the following items are not permitted in the residence halls: AC window units/space heaters, Foreman-style grills, open coiled cooking instruments, toasters/toaster ovens, water beds, halogen lamps, BB guns/air guns/paintball guns, knives (larger than a pocket knife), alcohol/drug paraphernalia, alcohol can/bottle collections, or pets (other than fish/10 gallon tank or less)!

Students are welcome to bring bikes, but are encouraged to bring a lock to secure it to one of several outdoor bike racks located throughout campus.  Bikes are not permitted in the residence halls, unless they are kept inside a student’s room.  

Several outdoor grills are available on campus surrounding the residence halls and are available for student use at any time.  Students are responsible for bringing their own supplies and cleaning up the area after they have finished.  

<em>Campus Mail</em>

All residential students have a campus mailbox located in the Cerf Center.  (Ivy Hall residents have a mailbox located in Ivy Hall.)  Commuter students are offered a campus mailbox on a first come, first serve basis.  Students are encouraged to check their mail at least once per day as faculty, staff, and students utilize campus mailboxes for distribution of notices, letters, and announcements.  

All students have the same campus mailing address, but with a specific box # that they will receive after they move in.  All mail can be addressed to:

<b>Student’s Name<br />
Eureka College<br />
300 E. College Ave. Box #______<br />
Eureka, IL  61530</b>

<em>Can I Decorate My Room?</em>

Residents are encouraged to decorate individual rooms to their liking. However, wallpaper and contact paper should not be used and students are not allowed to paint their rooms. Residents should also refrain from using nails, screws, and duct tape which cause lasting damage to the walls.  We strongly encourage residents to use putty and command strips to hang pictures and posters on the walls.  

<em>Is Storage Available?</em>

Eureka College does not offer storage space for residential students.  Residents wishing to store belongings during the year or over the summer are encouraged to call a local storage facility in Eureka or the surrounding area.  

<em>Can I Bring A Car?</em>

Currently, all residential students are welcome to bring a car to campus and register for a parking permit.  Although many residential students may enjoy having a car on campus, it is not a necessity.  All residential and commuter students wishing to bring a car must be sure to complete the Parking Registration Form.  This form should be completed before the first day of class in order to avoid receiving a parking ticket.  Residential students and commuter students each have designated parking lots that they must park in.  More information about specific parking lots is given out after a student registers for their parking permit.  There is not an additional charge to register for and receive a parking permit.
