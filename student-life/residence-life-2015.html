<h3 class="first-line">Welcome to EC Residence Life</h3>

<p>Choosing to live on campus may be one of the best decisions a student can make as we strongly believe that the "out of classroom" learning experience is a significant part of a college education!  We highly recommend that all students take advantage of this incredible opportunity.  Residence halls are more than just dorms or places to eat and sleep.  Living on campus provides great opportunities for students to develop meaningful friendships and get involved with campus programming, organizations, and the overall college community. For the 2014-2015 academic year, 87% of our first year freshmen lived on campus.</p>

<p>Our incoming students for Fall 2015 will be part of the second class of students that will be offered a $1000 grant awarded to all full-time students who choose to live on campus!  We are excited to be able to offer this opportunity to incoming students as Eureka College strongly believes that students are best able to take advantage of the full Eureka College experience by living on campus.  We opened a brand new residence hall, Ivy Hall, in January 2012 and have also recently completed an extensive series of renovations on our existing residence halls.  It's a great time to join our residential community!</p>

<p><b>To reserve your space in campus housing, please return a <a href="http://www.eureka.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/housing-contract-2015-16.pdf" alt="Housing Services Contract">Housing Services Contract</a> (will be mailed to you shortly after your acceptance to EC) along with a $100 refundable housing deposit.</b></p>

<p>While there is no guarantee of residence hall, we will give priority to the housing contracts and deposits received before April 1, 2015 based on the date that we receive them.  The deadline to request a specific roommate is June 1, 2015 for the fall semester.</p>

<hr class="hr-style">

<h4>Housing and Residence Life Mission Statement</h4>

<p>The Housing and Residence Life Department provides a safe, supportive, and comfortable living and learning environment that supports the mission of Eureka College.  The Residence Life Staff maintains a high standard of commitment and service in order to meet the diverse needs of our residents.  We work in collaboration with other campus educators to create a greater sense of community and atmosphere of tolerance, appreciation, and respect.  Through co-curricular programming, residents are empowered to achieve maximum success in academics, leadership, and campus and community involvement.</p>

<hr class="hr-style">

<h4>Themed Living-Learning Communities</h4>

<p>Eureka College's Themed Living-Learning Communities give students a unique, inclusive residential learning experience that connects classroom learning with residence life.  Students enjoy all of the usual advantages of living on campus in a residence hall, with the added benefit of living among a group that shares academic goals and another common interest. </p>

<p>Through student, faculty, and staff partnerships, and educational and cultural programs, active involvement in a Themed Living-Learning Community allows you to broaden your perspectives and understanding of the world around you.  This holistic approach complements classroom experiences and lays the foundation for you to become better prepared to succeed in life beyond college. <a href="http://www.eureka.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Themed-Living-Learning.pdf" alt="Themed Living Learning Application">Applications</a> are now available for current students to submit proposals for Themed Living-Learning Communities for the 2015&ndash;2016 academic year.</p>
