<h3 class="first-line">What is a Eureka College Leadership Ambassador?</h3>

<p>Students selected to serve as a Leadership Ambassador will belong to a team of fellow students who believe that leadership development and education is essential to the Eureka College experience.</p>

<p>Responsibilities include working collectively with other team members and program advisors to promote leadership education opportunities. By learning about our own leadership abilities and how to improve them, Leadership Ambassadors work to teach and foster positive, healthy leadership skills to Eureka students through (but not limited to) facilitating workshops, helping organizations on a need-to-need basis, being models of active, positive leadership for our peers and making resources accessible such as literature on leadership development relevant to students at Eureka.</p>

<p>As a Leadership Ambassador, your input is highly valued as to where not only leadership education on campus can improve, but also how the group Leadership Ambassadors can grow and transition, ensuring our relevance to students as well as growing as leaders ourselves. In order to do so, we ask that you commit to attending regular meetings held by Leadership Ambassadors, as well as actively help with Leadership Ambassador sponsored events.</p>

<p>Each year, two students are also selected to participate as Eureka College representatives at the LeaderShape Institute. LeaderShape applicants who are accepted become a part of Leadership Ambassadors as a continuation of promoting positive leadership on campus and an opportunity to apply your new skills from the Institute on campus. You may still apply for consideration as a Leadership Ambassador, even if you are not able to attend LeaderShape.</p>

<h4>What is LeaderShape?</h4>

<p>Named by the W.K. Kellogg Foundation as an "exemplary program," The <a href="http://www.leadershape.org">LeaderShape Institute</a> is an intensive, energizing, six-day educational experience designed to equip young adults to become extraordinary leaders. Each session of The LeaderShape Institute is comprised of approximately 60-70 students from diverse ethnic, religious, and cultural backgrounds. The Institute's curriculum is presented by a group of facilitators who are highly respected in their own professions and serve as excellent role models for the students.</p>

<p>In support of additional leadership initiatives, the college will provide the funding to send up to 2 students to attend a 6-day session of The LeaderShape Institute this 2016 summer.  For additional information, you are encouraged to <a href="http://www.leadershape.org">visit the Institute website</a>.</p>

<p>The students who attend The LeaderShape Institute this summer will be recognized at the Honors Ceremony April 24th, 2016. They will also be expected to give a presentation at the Summer Symposium in September 2016. </p>
