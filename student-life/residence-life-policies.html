	<p class="first-paragraph">Eureka College has in place a set of basic policies for living on campus. More information on residential policies may be accessed through the <a href="http://www.eureka.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Final-Handbook-2014-2015.pdf" target="_blank" class="underline">Student Handbook</a>.</p>
	
	<p>The State of Illinois law provides that any person less than 21 years of age who attempts to purchase, possess, consume, or transport any alcoholic beverages within Illinois is subject to fine or imprisonment or both.  The College does not condone violation of the law with respect to underage drinking.  Eureka College's full alcohol and other drug policy may be located in the <a href="http://www.eureka.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Final-Handbook-2014-2015.pdf" target="_blank" class="underline">Student Handbook </a>.</p>
	<p>All Eureka College residence halls are non-smoking. Those wishing to smoke must do so outside and at least 15 feet away from any entrance. Smoking receptacles are located near most halls on campus.</p>
	<p>If there is any damage or vandalism done in the residence halls on campus and the College cannot identify responsible individuals, the College may require that all of the residents of that floor and/or building pay a prorated group charge to cover the cost of the damage.</p>
	<p>Students are not allowed to burn candles or incense in their rooms.</p>
	<p>Guests and friends of residents are welcome on campus at any time. Residents wishing to have a guest over MUST have the consent of their roommate beforehand. Residents wishing to have a guest stay for more than three consecutive nights must have prior approval from Residence Life.  Students are responsible for the actions of their guest if the guest is not a student of Eureka College.</p>
	<p>Eureka College upholds "quiet hours" on every residence hall floor on campus from 11pm until 7am.  During this time, residents must keep music and all other noise to a minimum. "Courtesy hours" exist 24 hours a day. Therefore, residents must be respectful towards their neighbors, in regards to noise, at all times.</p>
	<p>There are no pets permitted in the residence halls, with the exception of fish, which must be kept in a 10 gallon tank or less. </p>
	<p>More information on residential policies may be accessed through the <a href="http://www.eureka.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Final-Handbook-2014-2015.pdf" target="_blank" class="underline">Student Handbook</a>.</p>
