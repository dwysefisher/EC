<p class="first-paragraph">Congratulations to our graduates who will soon join the alumni ranks! This significant milestone is just the beginning for your lifelong relationship with Eureka College. </p>

The 2014 Commencement exercises will be conducted for the 153rd time at Eureka College. The 2014 commencement ceremony will also serve as the kick-off event to commemorate the 160th anniversary of Eureka College's founding.

Founded by abolitionists in 1855, and as the first college in Illinois and the third in the nation to admit women on an equal basis as men, Eureka College has stayed true to its courageous founders' vision by maintaining its unrelenting efforts to provide equal opportunities for education and by remaining accessible and affordable for our student body. The 2014-2015 academic year anniversary celebration will center on the theme &lsquo;Honoring 160 Years Toward Equality of Opportunity,&rsquo; recognizing both the rich tradition of equality and our institutional desire to lead the industry of higher education in areas of diversity and inclusion.
