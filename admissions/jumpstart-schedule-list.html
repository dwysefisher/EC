<h3 class="first-line">Welcome New Students</h3>
<p>Congratulations on your selection of Eureka as your undergraduate college. In Greek, Eureka means, &ldquo;I have found it&rdquo; and at Eureka, you will find many new friends, outstanding faculty and staff, and amazing opportunities for learning inside and outside the classroom. Your participation in Jump Start will prepare you well for your undergraduate experience at EC.</p>

<p>Again, I personally welcome you to campus and the best of wishes on your high school graduation. I look forward to seeing all of you on campus in the fall!</p>

<p>Yours &lsquo;neath the Elms at Eureka College,<br />
