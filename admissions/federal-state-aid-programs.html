<h3 class="first-line">Federal/State Financial Aid Programs</h3>

<p><b>Illinois Monetary Award Program (MAP)</b><br />
The MAP Grant program is provided by the State of Illinois to legal residents of Illinois based on financial need.  Eligibility is based on information reported on the FAFSA.  MAP Grants do not need to be repaid.  Each year the State of Illinois has a deadline by which the FAFSA needs to be filed to be considered for this grant.  We encourage you to file the FAFSA as soon as possible after January 1st using estimated tax information to avoid missing this deadline.</p>

<p><b>Federal Pell Grant</b><br />
The Federal Pell Grant provides aid to students with very high need.  The amount of the Federal Pell Grant is based on the Expected Family Contribution as calculated on the FAFSA.  The Federal Pell Grant never has to be repaid.</p>

<p><b>Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (SEOG)</b><br />
The Federal SEOG is awarded to Pell Grant recipients with the highest financial need.  The amount of SEOG is determined by Eureka College based on available funding levels.  These funds are limited, and not all students who qualify can be assured that they will receive an SEOG grant. The Federal SEOG never has to be repaid. </p>

<p><b>Federal Perkins Loan</b><br />
This federally funded loan is based on financial need and must be repaid. The funds for this program are limited and are awarded to students with exceptional financial need as determined by the Financial Aid office.  A Perkins Loan has a fixed interest rate of 5% and a repayment grace period of 9 months.  No interest is charged and no payments are required on the principal while the student is enrolled at least half-time.  There are no origination fees associated with this loan.</p>

<p><b>Federal Direct Subsidized Loan</b><br />
This federally funded student loan is based on financial need and must be repaid.  The interest rate is determined annually by the Federal government and is currently 4.66%.  No interest is charged and no payments are required on the principal while the student is enrolled at least half-time.  Repayment begins 6 months after a student graduates, leaves school or falls below half-time.  The federal government charges processing fees before disbursing the loan proceeds.  Eureka College will request and receive the loan funds directly from the Federal government, half in each semester. </p>

<p><b>Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan</b><br />
This federally funded student loan is not based on financial need and must be repaid. The interest rate is determined annually by the Federal government and is currently 4.66%.  Unlike the subsidized loan, interest is charged while the student is enrolled.  The unsubsidized loan is identical to the subsidized loan in all other aspects.</p>

<p><b>Federal Direct PLUS Loan for Parents</b><br />
The Federal PLUS Loan is available to creditworthy parents and is not based on financial need and must be repaid. The interest rate is fixed and is currently 7.21%.  Repayment begins immediately after the last disbursement of the loan is made for the school year. This means that the parent must begin repayment while the student is still in school, although deferment is an option. The federal government charges fees between 4-5% of the loan before disbursing the loan proceeds.</p>

<p><b>Federal Work Study</b><br />
This federally funded program is based on financial need.  To receive this award, a qualifying student must obtain a campus job.  Federal Work Study dollars will fund the studentâ€™s paycheck and therefore will not be reflected on the EC student account.  It will be the responsibility of the student to determine how to use these funds wisely.  Federal Work Study is not a guarantee of job placement.  Federal Work Study awards are not required for students to obtain on campus jobs.</p>
