<h3>General Information</h3>

<h4>Campus Mail</h4>

<p>Every first-year and residential student is given a campus mailbox which is located in the Donald B. Cerf Center. Ivy Residence Hall has its own mail receptacle. It is important to check your mail on a daily basis as faculty, staff and students utilize the campus mailboxes for distribution of notices, letters, and announcements. Your campus box number must be included on incoming mail in order to ensure proper delivery.  Incoming mail should be addressed as follows:</p>
		<ul class="no-bullet">
			<li>Student&lsquo;s Name</li>
			<li>Eureka College # (Campus Box Number)</li>
			<li>300 E. College Avenue</li>
			<li>Eureka, IL  61530-1500</li>
		</ul>

<p>A transfer commuter student may request a campus mailbox through the Mailroom Office. Commuter campus mailboxes will be issued on a first come basis depending on availability.</p>

<h4>Computers/IT</h4>

<p>All resident halls have fiber connection to the campus network and to the Internet. Additionally, WiFi connectivity is available in a majority of the residence hall footprint. If you plan to use your own computer, make sure you have a network port on your computer.  Most computers now have built-in network ports. The College&lsquo;s Information Technology staff provides assistance with network connections. Students without computers have access through the computer labs in Vennum-Binkley Science Hall, Burgess Hall, Melick Library, Learning Center, and a 24-hour lab in Ben Major Center. These computer labs are open to all Eureka College students.</p>

<p>The Information Technology Department can only provide connectivity to the campus network and the Internet. If the issue is with a student&lsquo;s computer (a bad hard drive, viruses/spyware, applications, programs on their computer or some other hardware problem) they will need to resolve that issue first. Only then can the Information Technology Department assist with any connectivity issues. Students are encouraged to bring their own desktop or laptop, and maintain it in proper working order.</p>

<h4>E-mail</h4>

<p>Additionally, every student is provided an email address that is activated once the student is enrolled. It is also important to check your email account daily as instructors and offices regularly communicate by email with important announcements.</p>

<h4>Parking</h4>

<p>Students may bring an automobile to campus. All automobiles must be registered with the Office of Student Programs &amp; Services. The parking pass (obtained during Welcome Week or Orientation in January) must be displayed at all times.</p>

<h4>Health Information</h4>

<p>All students must submit a completed health questionnaire to the Office of Student Programs and Services prior to enrollment. Illinois State law requires that all students submit a record of current required immunizations.</p>

<p>Students participating in intercollegiate athletics must complete the enclosed <a href="http://www.eureka.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/insurance-verification.pdf">Insurance Verification</a>, <a href="http://www.eureka.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/medical-physical.pdf" class="underline">Physical Evaluation</a>, and <a href="http://www.eureka.edu/admissions/media-sid-questionnaire/">Sports Info Questionnaire</a> which includes proof of a physical examination performed by a licensed physician within 6 months of their first official practice.</p>

<p>Eureka College contracts with Eureka Community Hospital for health clinic services. All students, whether residential or commuting, may use the clinic at Eureka Community Hospital, as long as x-rays and extensive lab work (beyond CBC, throat culture and urinalysis) are not needed. There will be a co-pay fee charged to the student&lsquo;s account through the Business Office for each visit to the clinic.</p>

<p>The co-pay fee for the 2013&ndash;2014 school year will be $10*. The clinic&lsquo;s hours of service are 6am to 10pm daily during the academic school year. Services beyond basic evaluation and treatment and services outside of clinic hours are charged to the student&lsquo;s health insurance. Starter medicine packets and sport physicals are charged through the student&lsquo;s college account. Students must show their college ID every time they visit the clinic.</p>


<h4>Tuition Management</h4>

<p>As a service, a student&lsquo;s expenses may be spread over twelve (12), ten (10), or nine (9) monthly payments, without interest. The only cost is a $65* enrollment fee. This option will enable you to conserve savings and more easily budget costs. It is offered in cooperation with TUITION MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS (TMS), a nationwide leader in helping families afford education. Information on this program may be obtained by calling the Admissions Office, 1-888-438-7352, the Business Office at 1-800-548-9144, or by calling TMS direct, at 1-800-356-8329.</p>
