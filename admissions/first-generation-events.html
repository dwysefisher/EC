First Generation Program (2014&ndash;2015)</h3>

<p><b>Early College Program:  July 31&ndash;August 2, 2014 Eureka College</b></p>
<p>The first generation "Early College" program in the Humanities and Arts is the first event in a year&ndash;long series that will help students explore all aspects of the college and give students the support they need to succeed at Eureka College.</p>

<p>In workshops, small group discussions, and over meals, the students will interact with faculty, staff and administration to discuss questions about the human condition, spirituality, and creative and expressive responses to the world.  Through these interactions, we want to enable students to explore humanities and arts disciplines that are often very different from how they perceived them in high school. RSVP to Sarah Jiter by Friday, July 18.</p>

<p><b>The Joffrey Ballet:</b>  Unique Voices &amp; The Chicago Art Institute<br />
  February 21&ndash;22, 2015, Chicago, IL</p>
<p><em>Maninyas,</em> &ndash; Choreographer: Stanton Welch.  Music: Ross Edwards.</p>
<p> Contemporary in design and abstract in nature, Maninyas is a powerful, exotic and passionate ballet that explores the sometimes frightening process of revealing oneself layer by layer in a relationship.</p>

<p><em>The Man in Black</em> <br />
Choreographer: James Kudelka.  Music: Johnny Cash. </p>
<p>Six of Johnny Cash's later songs are given visual resonance in a suite of dances for an ensemble of three men and a woman, all in cowboy boots. The choreography riffs off several popular American country&ndash;western dance styles. Like the songs that inspired it, The Man in Black is an ode to the human spirit, vulnerable yet resilient.</p>

<p><em>Tulle</em><br />
Choreographer: Alexander Ekman. Music: Mikael Karlsson. </p>
<p>On the heels of Ekman's wildly successful Episode 31, we present a second ballet by the young Swedish choreographer. Featuring the full Joffrey company, voice&ndash;over commentary and three large onstage LED screens, this is a ballet about ballet. Part homage and part tongue&ndash;in&ndash;cheek critique, Ekman displays his fresh wit and serious craft.
