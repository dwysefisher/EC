<h4 class="first-line">Organizational Leadership program overview</h4>
	<p>Organizational change in the 21st century calls for leaders who are committed to serving others. The Eureka College Organizational Leadership program is our response to that call. The program is designed to prepare students to assume management-focused leadership positions at organizations in both the public and private sectors. Through a dynamic curriculum that links theory with best practices, students are trained in the  principles and skills of transformational leadership &ndash; leadership that translates vision into change.</p>
	<p>At the heart of the program is an interdisciplinary sequence of courses crafted to foster an understanding of individual and group behavior that is essential for effective leadership. This sequence is complemented by a practicum component, a unique experiential opportunity through which students are challenged to solve real-world leadership problems faced by their own organizations as well as those faced by  area groups, institutions, and companies. Students earn 61 credits in this degree  program.</p>
