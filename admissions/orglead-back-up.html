<h4 class="first-line">Degree Requirements</h4>
	<p>The Organizational Leadership program prepares students to assume management-focused leadership positions at organizations in both the public and private sectors. Through a dynamic curriculum that links theory with best practices, students are trained in the principles and skills of transformational leadership&mdash;leadership that translates vision into change within the team-based management environments that characterize  today's organizations.</p>
	 
	<p>A Bachelor of Science in Organizational Leadership is offered as a weekend program  throughout the year (including summers) to cohorts of students who sign up for the  entire experience. Admission to the program is limited to those who have the rough  equivalent of an associate's degree from an accredited two-year institution or at least 51 credit hours of transferable coursework from an accredited two- or four-year institution.  </p>
