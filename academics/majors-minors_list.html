<title>majors &amp; minors</title>
The academic program at Eureka College seeks to maintain a balance between requirements which all students must meet and freedom for each student to select those courses which will best match and further one's own interests, skills, and life plan. The structure of the curriculum has been designed to reflect this balance.

The College believes that there are certain basic skills and a common core of knowledge possessed by anyone who would call him/herself truly educated. Therefore, the College requires that each student acquire and display skills in composition, and mathematics. The College also requires that each student devote a portion of time to the study of humanities, fine and performing arts, natural sciences, and social sciences. These distributional requirements insure that each student will have the opportunity to explore that body of knowledge which is our common cultural heritage. The program at Eureka is rigorous both in its goals and in the effect it demands, but the College believes it is also exciting and satisfying.

<h4>Minor</h4>
<p>A minor consists of a minimum of 20 semester hours in a field with at least six hours at the 300 level and a minimum of six hours in Eureka College course work. Selection procedures for a minor are the same as for selecting a major. A minimum of twelve hours of credit in the minor must be taken outside the student's major field of study. </p>

&nbsp;
<h4>Majors</h4>
<p>Majors are designed to establish qualifications for a profession, vocation, and/or for entrance into graduate or professional schools. Students who have completed 54 semester hours are required to have an approved petition for major filed with the Records Office.</p>

<p>A major requires a minimum of 32 hours in a single discipline, with at least 12 hours at the 300 level or higher, and a minimum of 12 hours in Eureka College course work.</p>

<p>An individualized major enables a student to plan a program of courses based on individual educational and vocational objectives. Application for such a major must be made to the Office of the Dean of the College before the end of the sophomore year of study to provide adequate planning. The process of approval assures adequate concentration of courses including upper level work. The program is reviewed by the Dean and a committee of three faculty members. This major will be given a title and usually includes at least 42 semester hours in areas of concentration with 18 hours of upper level courses.</p>

&nbsp;
<h4>Double Major Option</h4>
<p>A graduate may be recognized for a second major, if an approved petition for both the primary and second major are processed with the Records Office before all graduation requirements have been met. Each course in the academic history of the student shall be counted toward the required semester hours for only one major. The petitions for the majors must indicate any special agreements as to how the requirements for each major will be met.</p>
