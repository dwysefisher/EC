<p class="first-paragraph">At Eureka College, prospective teacher candidates study a core curriculum of liberal arts in conjunction with a major field of study, and their potential is realized not only by the accumulation of knowledge, but by challenging experiences in the field and in co- curricular activities. Those entering the Teacher Education Program must display distinctive qualities of intellect and character as demonstrated through competencies in five key areas that embody the nine Professional Teaching Standards established by the Illinois State Teacher Licensure Board:</p>

<ul class="body-list">
	<li>Professionalism</li>
	<li>Classroom Management</li>
	<li>Content Knowledge</li>
	<li>Teaching Strategies</li>
