		<h4>Pre-Dentistry, Pre-Medicine, and Pre-Veterinary</h4>
		  <p>The student entering one of these pre-professional areas will usually major in biology or chemistry. However,  a student from any major may be accepted as long as he/she has the specific prerequisite courses for the professional school and successful performance on the professional admissions test in his/her area. Most medical, dental, and  veterinary schools require two years of chemistry, one year of biology, one year of physics, and psychology including at least PSY101; some require mathematics through Calculus II.</p>
		  
		  <p>These requirements can be fulfilled by completing:</p>

Students  who wish to major in History and Political Science may choose the Political  Science track with Pre-Law emphasis, which will appear on the student's  transcript.</p>
