<p class="first-paragraph">Design and media are particularly suited to interdisciplinary thinking. And, that's what we do best at Eureka College. </p>

<p>As a liberal arts institution, Eureka College offers a premier liberal arts experience where students gain a powerful grasp of the world, make connections across disciplines and gain broadly applicable, practical skills. </p>

<p>The new Digital Design & Media program at Eureka College blends areas as diverse as design, art, communication and business to provide students with well-rounded exposure as preparation for the dynamic, contemporary job market. </p>

<h4>Why study this program at Eureka?</h4>
<p>A 160-year old institution, what better place to study design and digital media than Eureka College? While that might seem counterintuitive, design is all about a strong foundation. With the right building blocks, even the most off-the-wall creations can be effective in achieving their goals. At Eureka College, in both the classroom and throughout the campus community, you can expect a strong, historic foundation combined with a thriving contemporary culture.  </p>
