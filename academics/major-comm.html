The Communication major provides students with the means to understand human communication as a tool and the means to grasp challenges and problems in the field of communication. Since communication is interdisciplinary, communication students gain skills that prepare them for careers in public relations, human relations, publishing, journalism, sales, education, customer service, training, management, human resources, broadcasting, communications, and other areas that require strong speaking, writing, and symbolizing abilities. Communication students are encouraged to learn through an internship affording beneficial experience in an area of special interest to the major. Communication majors should consider developing a concentration area, a minor, or a double major in a subject that contributes to their future professional goals.
