Computers have a significant impact on daily lives and on society. As a result, Computer science has numerous applications. The Computer Studies major at Eureka College is a blend of computer science and one of two application areas, Management Information Systems and Graphic Arts. The purpose of these computer science tracks is to prepare graduates for leadership roles in the use of computer technology in service to society.

    <ul>
    <li>Computer Studies &ndash; Management Information Systems Track blends computer science and business management concepts to provide a foundation for the use of technology in the business environment.</li>
    <li>Computer Studies &ndash; Graphic Arts Track blends computer science with art concepts to provide a foundation for the use of technology in visual, design, and other aesthetic applications.</li>
	</ul>
 

For students who choose to double major in Computer Studies/Mathematics, Computer Studies/Art, or Computer Studies/Business Administration, at least 27 hours out of the total 64 distinct hours must be in Computer Studies. The Computer Science Department also offers three minors (Computer Science, Computer Information Systems, and Technology Applications) for students of any major who wish to blend technology applications into their academic program. 

CSC135 is the appropriate introduction for most students. CSC110 and CSC115 are appropriate for non-majors and do not have a pre-requisite. Students who have prior coursework or experience should ask faculty if they should start with a higher-level class. Students are encouraged to take their math requirements early.
