       <h3>Pre-Law</h3>
            <p>Although certain courses are  recommended for students preparing to go on to law school after graduation from  Eureka, there is no one prescribed major.

Students  who wish to major in History and Political Science may choose the Political  Science track with Pre-Law emphasis, which will appear on the student's  transcript.</p>
