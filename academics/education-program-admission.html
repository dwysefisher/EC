<h4>Test of Academic Proficiency (TAP)</h4>
Students who start as freshmen at Eureka are required to pass the TAP before enrolling in EDU227W. All transfer students must pass the TAP by their second semester in order to take any EDU/SPE courses during their third semester of enrollment. More information on the TAP, including registering for the test, can be found <a href="http://www.il.nesinc.com" target="blank">here</a>.
<hr>

<h4>Selection and Continuance</h4>
Each teacher candidate is responsible for having a knowledge of and following all regulations and procedures stipulated in the Teacher Education Admission Handbook and the Students’ Responsibilities and Rights Handbook, various practica handbooks, both student teaching handbooks, the Eureka College Catalog and the Eureka College Student Handbook. 

Continuance in the Teacher Education Program is based on a candidate’s GPA and dispositions. A check of each candidate’s dispositions is conducted at the time of admission to the program and reviewed yearly after admission. A Disposition Review may be initiated and conducted by College faculty at any time. Reviews of the program may also result in changes and will be announced as they occur.

Students who plan to teach must understand that preparation for teaching consists of more than satisfactory completion of a sequence of courses. Teaching requires above average scholarship but also good character and sound mental health. Teacher Education personnel, therefore, reserve the right:
<ul class="body-list">
	<li>to grant admission to any course or permission to continue a sequence of courses leading to licensure;</li>
	<li>to make recommendations for licensure by entitlement;</li>
	<li>to require that students take aptitude, achievement, and health examinations;</li>
	<li>to use information from these and other sources in making decisions and recommendations about admission and continuance.</li>
</ul>
