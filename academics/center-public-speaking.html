<h4>Why it's important</h4>

Public speaking is the number one fear in America. However, overcoming this fear is critical to success in life. Looking beyond the academic world, strong public speaking is considered to be the most highly valued skill employers look for when hiring new recruits (Massengate, 2014).  The Center for Public Speaking and Discourse allows students of all majors to develop and refine public speaking skills with trained communication attendants.  The Speech Center is set up to emulate the classroom experience, providing students with a comfortable environment in which to prepare oral presentations.  Peer consultants are trained to work with students on all elements of the speechmaking process, including topic selection, the search for supporting materials, organization, and delivery.  

<h4>Services Available</h4>

The Center for Public Speaking and Civil Discourse is able to serve students in a variety of areas, offering presentation consultations for COM110 (the introductory-level public speaking class), a safe place to practice for an upcoming honors thesis or upper-level academic presentation, and any needs between.  The Speech Center welcomes both individual and group presenters and can help at any stage of the process.  Even if you do not have a presentation, the Speech Center can help train you in technology such as green screen or GoPro cameras.
