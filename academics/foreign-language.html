<p class="first-paragraph">Courses in Foreign Language provide enrichment; students learn not only the language of the various countries but also their culture, thus gaining awareness of cultural diversity. By comparing the new language to their own, students also become more aware of their own language’s structure. Eureka College offers courses in Ancient Greek and French, and a minor in Spanish. Elementary Education majors can choose specializations in French or Spanish.</p>

<p>As the Hispanic population in The United States continues to grow, a vista of career opportunities will become available for those with a knowledge of Spanish. A Spanish minor will provide the student with this knowledge and with an appreciation for cultural diversity.</p>
