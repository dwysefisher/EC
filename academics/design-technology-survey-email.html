<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>I realize that right now, classes for the 2015-16 academic year are probably the farthest thing from your mind. That being said, I'd like to ask a quick favor of you before you leave for the summer.</p>
<p>In preparation for the ART206* class, I'd like to know a bit about what tools and resources you have. I would appreciate it if you would take&ndash;literally&ndash;a minute to complete it. You can help shape and influence the direction of our new Digital and Media Design major.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.eureka.edu/digital-media-design-survey/">Complete the survey</a>.</p>
<p>I'm excited to meet and work with you in the fall.</p>
<p>Good luck with the rest of your semester.</p>
<p>Please feel free to contact me with questions or concerns.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Dustin<br />

<p>* Please note that if you are taking ART106, you'll also be receiving this email. You only need to complete it once.</p>
