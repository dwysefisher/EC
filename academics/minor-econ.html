Economics refers to the scientific study of buying and selling behavior. As such, it represents one of the foundational social science disciplines in a liberal arts education. Eureka College offers a minor in Economics, and coursework in Economics support the general education curriculum and serve the needs of students majoring in Accounting, Business Administration, Computer Studies with Management Information Systems, Elementary Education-Social Science, and History with Teacher Certification.

The Economics minor is designed to appeal to students from a variety of disciplinary backgrounds and will therefore serve various campus constituencies.  Although the primary course content of the minor will consist of Economics courses, students will be able to craft the minor specifically to one of five “focus” areas.  These include a Finance Focus, a General Business Focus, an International Focus, a Behavioral Focus, and a Quantitative Methods Focus.

The Economics minor consists of 21 credit hours, including 15 credit hours of core coursework and 6 credit hours of coursework in one of five focus areas.
