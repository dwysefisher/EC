<h4>Prizes</h4>

<p>Eureka College will produce six scripts written by Illinois High School students. The six plays will be selected from all entries in the following categories:</p>

<ul class="body-list no-bullet">
  <li>Class of 2014: 1 script</li>
  <li>Class of 2015: 1 script</li>
  <li>Class of 2016: 1 script</li>
  <li>Class of 2017: 1 script</li>
  <li>At-Large: 2 scripts</li>
</ul>

<p>In the event that no scripts from a class are submitted, another at-large script will be chosen. All student scripts are eligible for selection in the studentâ€™s class rank and the At-Large openings.</p>

<h4>Submission Guidelines:</h4>
<ul class="body-list">
  <li>All submissions are judged blind and this requires two types of cover pages. One will include your name, address, phone number, e-mail and the play title. We also request the name of your high school and your current year (Class of 201X).  The other cover page should only have the title. There can be no identifying information on the script other than the title.</li> 
  <li>Electronic submissions will be allowed.</li>
  <li>Submissions must be original, unpublished 10-minute plays. </li>
  <li>Plays should be written in <a href="http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/standardprofessionalplayformat.pdf" class="underline">proper script format</a></li>
  <li>There is no limit to number of plays that an individual may submit.</li>
  <li>Production requirements should be feasible. Since the winning plays will be produced, no play considered technically un-producible will be considered.</li> 
  <li>Recommended maximum number of characters per play is four.</li> 
  <li>Running time is to be 10 minutes or less, which may mean 6-10 pages depending upon the density of dialogue. Authors are responsible for submitting work that is within the 10 minute running time limit. Cuts will be requested of the playwright for any selected play which runs over the limit regardless of the number of pages in the script. </li>
  <li>Mailed scripts must be typed/word-processed, numbered, and stapled.</li> 
  <li>Scripts cannot be returned. Eureka College and the Peoria Live Theatre League assume no responsibility for lost or damaged scripts.</li>
  <li>We are unable at this time to provide feedback to playwrights regarding their work.</li>
</ul>
