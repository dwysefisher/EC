<p class="first-paragraph">Answers to some of the commonly asked questions about living on campus.</p>


<p><strong>When are bills/statements mailed or available for viewing?</strong><br />
  Eureka College bills by semester. Semester 1 (Fall) bills are mailed in the middle of July and semester 2 (Spring) bills are mailed in the middle of December. Student statements/bills are available to be view and make payments on-line through the student's <a href="https://ww10.eureka.edu/sonisweb/">SonisWeb account</a>. Learn more about Eureka College <a href="http://www.eureka.edu/admissions/tuition-fees/">tuition and fees</a>.</p>

<h5>Payment Options</h5>
<p><strong>When are payments due for each semester?</strong><br />
There are three approved payment plans to choose from:</p>
 <ol>
 	<li>Pay in FULL:  Pay Eureka College in full.  Semester 1 (fall) due date of August 15th; Semester 2 (spring) due date of January 15th. </li>
	<li>TWO payment plan &ndash; Pay two equal payments to Eureka College.  Semester 1 (fall) due dates of &frac12; balance due August 15th and remaining &frac12; due October 1st; Semester 2 (spring) due dates of &frac12; balance due January 15th and remaining &frac12; due March 1st.</li>
	<li>Monthly payments through Tuition Management Systems.  If choosing this option, contact TMS at 1-800-722-4867 or eureka.afford.com to enroll.  (There is an enrollment fee for this service and you must enroll by August 15th.  If students/families do NOT enroll in the monthly pay plan, Eureka College will automatically expect the TWO pay option was chosen.</li>
	</ol>

<hr>

<p><strong>How does the Tuition Management (Payment Plan 3) work?</strong><br />
Eureka College works in cooperation with the company Tuition Management Systems. TMS allows student/families to divide their yearly 'cost to attend' Eureka College over several months. You will pay TMS directly and they will remit your monthly payment to Eureka College approximately two weeks later.   Your options for the academic year are a 12, 10, or 9 month plan. (You must enroll and make your first payment by May 15th for the 12 month plan). </p>

<p>* If you enroll in the TMS monthly payment option, it is your responsibility to audit your Eureka College account throughout the year to make sure your TMS budget will cover the TOTAL amount due to Eureka College. Due to privacy issues, TMS does not have access to your Eureka College account. If you find that an adjustment is needed to your TMS monthly payments (up or down) to cover the TOTAL amount due to Eureka College, contact TMS and they will be able to assist you.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>How do you make a payment on a Eureka College student account?</strong><br />
There are several ways to make a payment directly to Eureka College if payment option 3 (TMS) is not chosen.</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Online by going through your Eureka College student <a href="https://ww10.eureka.edu/sonisweb/">SonisWeb account</a> and choosing the account/billing tab. This is the preferred method, using debit or credit card. The student username and password are needed. It needs to be a student's choosing to share that information with the payer of your account is their decision. Eureka College cannot and will not share student log in information with any other individual.</li>
		<li>In person at the Business Office located in Burrus Dickinson Hall (M-F  8:00am-4:00pm)</li>
		<li>By mail - send check or money order to Eureka College Business Office, 300 East College Avenue, Eureka, IL 61530</li>
		<li>By phone - call Business Office at 309-467-6309 with a credit or debit card</li>
	</ol>
		
<p><strong>If the three payment options offered are difficult for our budget, what other options are available to pay for our yearly 'cost to attend' Eureka College?</strong></p>

<p>Student/families can look into additional loans.</p>
<ul class="body-list">
	<li>Alternative loans from any lender (bank).  (loan in the student's name with cosigner)
Eureka College does not endorse any lender.  Interest and terms vary by lender.  It takes approximately two weeks to process these loans. <a href="http://www.eureka.edu/admissions/paying-for-school/">Learn more</a>.</li>
	<li>Federal Parent Plus loan (loan in Parent's name for the Student)
The processing fee and interest rates are subject to change in July of each year. The interest rate is fixed for the life of the loan. Repayment begins 60 days after the disbursement.  An endorser can help a parent qualify.  Parents can <a href="http://www.studentloans.gov">apply online</a>, and determination of eligibility is made within 24-48 hours.</li>
	<li>Payment Plan and Loan Combination
If your family budget can manage a small monthly payment, you might consider a combination of long-term loan (through the Federal PLUS or private loans above) and a monthly payment plan through TMS (option 3). This combination would be designed to meet your budget and cover the entire cost.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p><strong>What is a "Right to Cancel" letter or email?  </strong></p>
<p>If a parent receives a "Right to Cancel" letter, you've taken out a Federal Direct PLUS loan and we are required to ask the parent if they want to reduce, cancel or keep the loan.  If this loan creates a credit (overpayment), the parent needs to inform us what to do with this credit: refund (and to whom) or hold on account for future expenses.  If the student has a credit, but it is not due to a PLUS loan, the student must come to the Business Office to request a refund or instruct us to hold for future semesters.  Bottom line: if there is a credit balance, some action must be taken on this communication.  No action is needed if there is no credit and no change is desired in the Federal Loan.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>How do we know if an account has a credit balance?</strong></p>
<p>If your billing statement has a final balance with parentheses around it, this is an overpayment/credit.  Students can access his/her account at any time from any computer by logging onto <a href="https://ww10.eureka.edu/sonisweb/">SonisWeb account</a> and choosing the anticipated balance/balance due tab.</p>

<hr>

<h5>Account hold</h5>
<p><strong>The student account has a Registration Hold-Business Office noted. What does this mean?</strong></p>
<p>Financial holds are placed on student accounts to prevent registration of classes, requesting transcripts, or receiving a diploma if a student fails to pay their student account or any monies due and owing to Eureka College by the scheduled due dates.  Once financial obligation is resolved, holds are removed. </p>

<hr>

<h5>Meal Plans</h5>

<p><strong>What are the differences in plans?</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.eureka.edu/admissions/tuition-fees/">View to meal plan rates</a>.</p>

<p>For resident students:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>19 Meal Plan (Meal plan option A) &ndash; This plan covers 3 meals a day Mon-Fri, and 2 a day on Sat. and Sun.  There are no flex dollars; one meal per meal period as served at the dining facilities</li>
		</ul>
	<p>Block plans are offered to provide flexibility &ndash; Flexible use: meals can be used at any time of day and for students' guests</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Block 175 Plan &ndash; (Meal plan option B) Total of 175 meals per semester plus flex money (average 12 meals/week)</li>
		<li>Block 150 Plan- (Meal plan option C) Total of 150 meals per semester plus flex money (average 10 meals/week);</li>
		<li>Block 125 Plan &ndash; (Meal plan option D) Total of 125 meals per semester plus flex money (average 8 meals/week);</li>
	</ul>
	
<p>Meals do not carry over from semester to semester; Flex carries over from semester 1 (fall) to semester 2 (spring), but expires at the conclusion of semester 2 (spring) semester.</p>

<p>* Students are responsible for <a href="https://eureka.campuscardcenter.com">monitoring meal usage by setting up an account</a>. At this website, money may be added to a student's account for his or her use on campus. Commuter plans may be purchased by resident students if they run out of their block plan meals before semester ends.</p>

<p>For commuter students:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Block 30 Plan (30 meals, plus flex money), Block 10 Plan (10 meals, no flex money).  Any remaining meals or flex at the end of the semester 1 (fall) carry over, but are forfeited at the end of semester 2 (spring). Payment must be made at time of purchase.</li>
	</ul>

<p><strong>A student wants a different meal plan. How do you change meal plans?</strong></p>
<p>Residential students may stop by the Business Office to fill out a meal plan change form during the first week of the semester until 4:00 pm of the business on the first Friday of the semester.</p>

<hr>

<h5>Student 1098T tax forms</h5>
<p>Students will have access to their 1098T tax form on his/her SonisWeb account by January 31st.  Students will be notified by email and a new icon will be noted that will enable the student to print this form or forward the 1098T tax form.</p>

<hr>

<h5>Student Insurance</h5>
<p>All students are required to show proof that they are covered under a basic health insurance plan.  If a student does not have insurance the student will be required to purchase the College plan. <a href="http://www.eureka.edu/on-campus/business-office/">Find more information and instructions</a> on how to provide proof of insurance or the college plan offered.</p>
   
<hr>

<h5>Financial aid</h5> 
<p>IMPORTANT!! The process of filing the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) is a process you must go through each year. </p>

<p><strong>What can parents do to help their student navigate the business part of going to college?</strong></p>
<p>First, talk with your student about your payment intentions.  Discuss your plan for following the student's privacy rights.  Eureka College is bound by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) which prohibits Eureka College from releasing any information from a student's education record without written permission.  Support your student as they transition to adulthood through the responsible handling of their own educational matters.  Encourage your student to communicate accurate information and work as a partner with your student. </p>

<p>Second, encourage your student to come ask questions. A student should never sign anything without understanding it.  </p>

<p>Third, most urgently, your student MUST CHECK AND READ EC email and snailmail.  All official communications are in these forms and many students ignore both forms of mail.  You and your student miss out on many issues that become urgent because of the delay.  Respond to all correspondence.  College brings a lot of forms, deadlines and questions; this is a good time for students to begin to deal with business issues while there is still a support system behind them.</p>
