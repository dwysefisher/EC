<p class="first-paragraph">There are some new faces around Eureka College these days reflecting the institution's storied past. The faces appear on maroon banners depicting 20 prominent alumni from the college's 160-year history. The banners hang from lampposts dotting the campus.</p>

<p>College officials selected certain alumni from throughout the decades, but, "The men and women pictured on the banners really represent all of the Eureka College alumni who have and who are making a difference in the world," Vice President of Institutional Advancement Mike Murtagh said. </p>
