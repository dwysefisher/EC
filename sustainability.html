<h3 class="first-line">Making a Difference</h3>

<p>Eureka College’s core value of Stewardship and Sustainability emphasizes the commitment of the college to managing "<em>our resources in ways that preserve both the college and our natural resources for future generations</em>." During the Spring semester of 2011, five students participated in a new service learning course, "Assessing Sustainability on the EC Campus." The students worked with staff and faculty members to gather data about campus sustainability indicators and to provide Eureka College management with a preliminary campus sustainability assessment.</p>

<h4>Indicators of Sustainability at EC</h4>
<ul class="body-list">
  <li>Energy use</li>
  <li>Solid waste management</li>
  <li>Water use</li>
  <li>Dining services</li>
  <li>Landscaping, grounds, and building management</li>
</ul>

<h3>Sustainability in (and out of) the Classroom</h3>

<h5>Botany</h5>
The Spring 2014 Botany class is doing research and experiments to decide which species of plants to plant in the landscaping around the new addition, <a href="http://www.eureka.edu/giving/sanders-hall">Sanders Hall</a>. The main objectives in choosing the plants are that they will be native, aesthetically pleasing, and they will help to absorb and retain any storm water that runs off the building allowing it to soak into the ground to replenish the ground water supply as opposed to running into the sewer system.  All in order gain points for LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certification! 

<h5>Ecology and Conservation Biology</h5>
The Ecology and Conservation Biology classes have been participating in an ongoing frog survey at The Nature Conservancy’s constructed wetlands on Franklin Farm near Bloomington-Normal.

<h5>Research Methods of Environmental Studies and Environmental Studies Capstone</h5>
Students learn how to do research with a focus on helping others in the community.  A recent Research Methods class decided to research a topic important to everyone: recycling within the community. The result of this project was getting a sign posted on Rt. 117 in Eureka to point to the direction of the local recycling center.  

<h5>Microbial Ecology</h5>
Although not focused solely on sustainability, students have taken part in the <a href="http://americangut.org/">American Gut Project</a>, which takes waste samples from people across the country to sequence the DNA of the microbes that inhabit their guts.
