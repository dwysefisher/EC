<h3 class="first-line">Leadership starts here</h3>
<p>Named for a Eureka alumnus who became one of the greatest world leaders of the twentieth century, the Ronald W. Reagan Leadership Program is among the most innovative and opportunity-rich programs in the nation. As Eureka College&rsquo;s premier scholarship, the program is the only one of its kind in the country, founded by <a href="http://www.eureka.edu/reagan/reagan-legacy/">President Ronald Reagan</a> during his first term in office. </p>

<p>Reagan Fellows receive a four-year, full-tuition scholarship at Eureka College, as well as stipends to cover the program&rsquo;s special travel and mentoring opportunities. Up to six Fellows are selected annually from a nationally competitive pool of applicants. </p>

<hr class="hr-style">
<p>In addition, Reagan Fellows benefit from distinctive opportunities to learn and practice leadership skills. Each Reagan Fellow completes two on-site mentorships with prominent leaders of their choosing at locations worldwide. Recent professional mentorships for Reagan Fellows have included: </p>

<h5>First year, fellow-only trips to both domestic and international destinations.</h5>
<p>These expense-paid trips expose Reagan Fellows to one-of-a-kind experiences only available through Eureka and the college's affiliations, while building a strong sense of camaraderie among Fellow cohorts.</p>

<h5>The role of a Reagan Fellow</h5>
<p>In addition to meeting the expectations outlined for all Eureka students, Reagan Fellows are expected to live on campus, to maintain a grade-point average of 3.0 or higher, and to display to the College community the attributes of leadership, service, and active citizenship. Reagan Fellows are also expected to participate fully in all activities of the Program.</p>

<h5>Simply put&hellip;</h5>
<p>The Eureka College Reagan Fellowship Program is one of the best educational experiences that any student can have. EC is an incredible family populated with some of the finest, most dedicated and caring individuals in the world. With a history of over 150 years of excellence in learning, service, and leadership as our guiding force&hellip;EC is a gem.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the College simply cannot accommodate everyone. Entrance is limited. Apply early and reserve your place in history at EC.</p>
