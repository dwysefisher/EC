<h3 class="first-line">College Policy on Disclosure of student information</h3>

<p>The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (<abbr>FERPA</abbr>), as defined in 1974 and subsequently amended, is a federal law that protects the privacy of student education records. The law applies to all schools that receive funds under an applicable program of the U.S Department of Education.</p>

<p>Eureka College maintains an educational record for each student who is or has been enrolled at the College. In accordance with FERPA, all eligible students have the following rights under this act:</p>

	<ul class="body-list">
		<li>The right to inspect and review the student's educational records maintained by the school.</li>
		<li>The right to request that a school correct records which a student believes to be inaccurate or misleading.</li>
		<li>If the school decides not to amend the record, the student has a right to request a formal hearing to challenge the content of the educational record. After the hearing, if the school decides not to amend the record, the student has the right to place a statement with the record setting forth his or her view about the contested information.</li>
		<li>The right to prevent disclosure without consent of the student, with certain exceptions, of information from the student's educational records.</li>
		<li>The College must receive written permission from a student in order to release any information from a student's educational record. FERPA does allow schools to disclose without the student's consent the following information to the parties or under the conditions specified:
			<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
				<li>School officials with legitimate educational interest;</li>
				<li>Other schools to which a student is transferring;</li>
				<li>Specified officials for audit or evaluation purposes;</li>
				<li>Appropriate parties in connection with financial aid for a student;</li>
