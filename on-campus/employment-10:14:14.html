<h3 class="first-line">About the College</h3>
Focused on "excellence in learning, service, and leadership," Eureka currently has nearly 700 students enrolled in 23 undergraduate degree programs. The College was named to the President’s Higher Education Community Service Honor Roll for three consecutive years, rated No. 1 in the Midwest on the US News “Great Schools, Great Prices” best value list twice, and is cited as one of fifty national "All-American Colleges" by the Intercollegiate Studies Institute. Chartered in 1855 by abolitionists who were members of the Christian Church (<a href="http://www.disciples.org/" target="_blank">Disciples of Christ</a>), Eureka provides a non-sectarian liberal arts education and was the first college in Illinois and the third in the nation to admit men and women on an equal basis—equality of educational opportunity continues to be a focus of the College. Alumni include forty-two college presidents, seven governors and members of Congress, and the 40th President of the United States.

The town of Eureka offers the ambiance of a small town combined with easy access to the amenities of metropolitan areas. Eureka's mid-state region is Illinois' largest business and commercial center outside Chicago. Nearby Peoria, Bloomington, and Normal, Illinois offer a wide range of cultural opportunities, with Chicago and St. Louis less than three hours away. Two private universities and a state university are within a 30 mile radius.

Eureka College is an equal opportunity employer committed to achieving diversity within its administration, faculty, staff, and students.

<h3>Student Employment Openings</h3>
Eureka College offers part time employment opportunities for our students. There are a finite number of positions available and Eureka wishes to expand these opportunities across the greatest number of eligible students. To accomplish this goal, students generally are not allowed to hold two part-time positions simultaneously.  Certain positions require experience or special skill which warrants an exception to this policy.  In these cases the hiring supervisor must provide the Human Resources Office with written justification of the need to award the student an additional job.  An exception to this requirement exists for students that work for Sodexo. Sodexo is a separate entity from Eureka College and a supplier of EC services.

A student must initiate a request for a job interview through the Human Resources office by obtaining an Interview Authorization Slip.

A work study award does not guarantee availability of a job or that the student will earn the total award. Paychecks are distributed every two weeks for hours actually worked.

Students must complete an I-9 Employment Eligibility form, provide original documents to verify Employment Eligibility, and State and Federal W-4 tax withholding forms before they can begin working on campus.

<h4><strong><em>Reagan Pool Lifeguard</em></strong></h4>
