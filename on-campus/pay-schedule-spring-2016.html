<p class="first-paragraph">Exempt employees generally are paid semi-monthly, on the 15th and the last day of the month. Non-exempt employees generally are paid bi-weekly on Friday. If a pay day falls on a holiday, Saturday, or Sunday, employees are paid the last business day prior to such holiday, Saturday or Sunday. The Eureka College payroll is electronically transferred and directly deposited into the employee's bank account.</p>

*Paychecks will be mailed if applicable</b>

All time sheets must be submitted by 12:00 noon on the date due (unless specified otherwise). <b>Time sheets submitted after 12:00 noon on the due date will not be processed until the next pay period.</b> Time sheets must show only the hours worked during the current pay period. Hours worked during the previous pay periods, but not submitted on the proper time sheet must be noted in the comment section. Hours shown for the next reporting period will be deducted without notice. It is your responsibility to see that the hours are recorded properly.

Paychecks will be distributed by <b>noon</b> on the payday indicated above, unless the check is being held in the Business Office. In that case, a reminder note will be put in the student's mailbox.

<b>Time sheets must include the correct department number and be signed by both the student and the supervisor!</b> A current W-4 Federal and State Withholding form and a Federal 1-9 form must be on file in the Human Resources Office before students can begin working on campus!
[/accordion-item][accordion-item title="Hourly non-exempt staff bi-weekly pay schedule"]
All time sheets must be in the Business Office no later than 9:00 am on the 'Time Sheets Due' date specified unless otherwise noted. Time sheets submitted after that time will be processed on the next payroll.
