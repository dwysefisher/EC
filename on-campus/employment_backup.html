<h3>Student Employment Openings</h3>
<p>Eureka College offers part time employment opportunities for our students. There are a finite number of positions available and Eureka wishes to expand these opportunities across the greatest number of eligible students. To accomplish this goal, students generally are not allowed to hold two part-time positions simultaneously.  Certain positions require experience or special skill which warrants an exception to this policy.  In these cases the hiring supervisor must provide the Human Resources Office with justification of the need to award the student a second job.  An exception to this requirement exists for students that work for Sodexo. Sodexo is a separate entity from Eureka College and a supplier of EC services.</p>

A student must initiate a request for a job interview through the Human Resources office.

A work study award does not guarantee availability of a job or that the student will earn the total award. Paychecks are distributed every two weeks for hours actually worked.

To be employed, students must complete an I-9 Employment Eligibility form and State and Federal W-4 forms.

Students must obtain an Interview Authorization Slip before applying for a job.

***** INTERVIEW SLIPS ARE AVAILABLE IN HUMAN RESOURCES*****
