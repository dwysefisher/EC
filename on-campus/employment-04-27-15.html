The College was named to the President's Higher Education Community Service Honor Roll for three consecutive years, rated No. 1 in the Midwest on the US News "Great Schools, Great Prices" best value list twice, and is cited as one of fifty national "All-American Colleges" by the Intercollegiate Studies Institute. Chartered in 1855 by abolitionists who were members of the Christian Church (<a href="http://www.disciples.org/" target="_blank">Disciples of Christ</a>), Eureka provides a non-sectarian liberal arts education and was the first college in Illinois and the third in the nation to admit men and women on an equal basis—equality of educational opportunity continues to be a focus of the College. Alumni include forty-two college presidents, seven governors and members of Congress, and the 40th President of the United States.

<hr />

<h3>Student employment openings</h3>
Eureka College offers part time employment opportunities for our students. There are a finite number of positions available and Eureka wishes to expand these opportunities across the greatest number of eligible students. To accomplish this goal, students generally are not allowed to hold two part-time positions simultaneously. Certain positions require experience or special skill which warrants an exception to this policy. In these cases the hiring supervisor must provide the Human Resources Office with written justification of the need to award the student an additional job. An exception to this requirement exists for students that work for Sodexo. Sodexo is a separate entity from Eureka College and a supplier of EC services.

A student must initiate a request for a job interview through the Human Resources office by obtaining an Interview Authorization Slip.

A work study award does not guarantee availability of a job or that the student will earn the total award. Paychecks are distributed every two weeks for hours actually worked.

Students must complete an I-9 Employment Eligibility form, provide original documents to verify Employment Eligibility, and complete State and Federal W-4 tax withholding forms before they can begin working on campus.
