<h3 id="top">About the College</h3>
Eureka is a small residential liberal arts college located equidistant between the cities of Peoria and Bloomington/Normal. The campus is situated on 65 wooded acres with 24 academic and residential buildings in the city of Eureka, Illinois. Focused on “excellence in learning, service, and leadership,” Eureka graduates include forty-two college presidents, seven governors and members of Congress, and the 40th President of the United States, Ronald W. Reagan. Eureka currently has almost 800 students enrolled in 25 degree programs. The College has been recognized on <em>US News</em> “Great Schools, Great Prices” and “Least Debt” lists, on the President's Higher Education Community Service Honor Roll, and by the Intercollegiate Studies Institute as one of fifty national “All-American Colleges.” Chartered in 1855 to provide a “non-sectarian liberal arts” education by abolitionists who were members of the Christian Church (<a href="http://www.disciples.org/" target="_blank">Disciples of Christ</a>), Eureka was the first college in Illinois and the third in the nation to admit men and women on an equal basis.

<h3>Student Employment Openings</h3>
Eureka College offers part time employment opportunities for our students. There are a finite number of positions available and Eureka wishes to expand these opportunities across the greatest number of eligible students. To accomplish this goal, students generally are not allowed to hold two part-time positions simultaneously.  Certain positions require experience or special skill which warrants an exception to this policy.  In these cases the hiring supervisor must provide the Human Resources Office with justification of the need to award the student a second job.  An exception to this requirement exists for students that work for Sodexo. Sodexo is a separate entity from Eureka College and a supplier of EC services.

A student must initiate a request for a job interview through the Human Resources office.

A work study award does not guarantee availability of a job or that the student will earn the total award. Paychecks are distributed every two weeks for hours actually worked.

To be employed, students must complete an I-9 Employment Eligibility form and State and Federal W-4 forms.

Students must obtain an Interview Authorization Slip before applying for a job.

***** INTERVIEW SLIPS ARE AVAILABLE IN HUMAN RESOURCES*****
