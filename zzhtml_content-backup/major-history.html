Courses in History and Political Science seek to provide a general understanding of the framework of the past, to provide a basis for comprehending the dynamic forces that shape events, and to develop a sense of perspective with which to view the trends of the present world. The major is recommended for students preparing for secondary teaching, graduate study in History or Political Science, or the study of law. The major has four separate tracks:

<ul>
<li>History Track</li>
<li>History with Teacher Certification Track</li>
<li>Political Science Track</li>
<li>Political Science with Pre-Law Emphasis Track</li>
</ul>

The student must complete one track, which will appear on the studentâ€™s transcript. The History tracks within the major are designed to provide a broad background of historical knowledge as well as concentration in depth in an area. The Political Science tracks within the major are designed to help students understand the political systems of the United States and other nations and analyze the role of the U.S. government in international relations and foreign policy.
