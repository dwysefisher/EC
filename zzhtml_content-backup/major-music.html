Courses in music provide opportunities for enrichment through a variety of musical experiences, including classroom study, group and private lessons, and ensemble participation. The major in Music serves as a foundation for further study in graduate school and for careers in performance, composition, and education.  Music majors choose either the Performance Emphasis track or the Non-Performance Emphasis track.  The music minor, combined with a major in Business Administration or Communication, offers opportunities for careers in arts management, music broadcasting, and music business.
