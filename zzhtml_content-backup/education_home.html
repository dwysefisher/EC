     <p>We each have a favorite teacher, someone who challenged our abilities, who made a point while making us laugh; whose classes were the bright spot of each school day. The education division gives you the opportunity to follow in your favorite teacher's footsteps, to inspire your students and develop their passion for learning. Through one curriculum, you'll learn the skills and techniques, as well as the ethics and professionalism you need in order to be a knowledgeable, effective, and successful teacher.</p>

     <p>The goal statements of Eureka College are introduced by a sentence which has been selected as the descriptor for the Teacher Education Program's Conceptual Framework:</p>
     
     <h5><strong>"The true purpose of education is to realize the potential of the whole person."</strong></h5>
     <p>At Eureka, prospective teacher education students study a core curriculum of liberal arts in conjunction with a major field of study, and their potential is realized not only by the accumulation of knowledge, but by challenging experiences in the field and in co-curricular activities. Those entering teacher education must have distinctive qualities of intellect and character as demonstrated through competencies in five key areas:</p>
     <ul>
         <li>Professionalism</li>
         <li>Classroom Management</li>
         <li>Content Knowledge</li>
         <li>Teaching Strategies</li>
         <li>Technology Literacy</li>
     </ul>
