<h4>A Note From Home...<br />
Tis the Season to be Thankful</h4>

<p>Thankfulness...sometimes it comes naturally. Other times we have to dig deep. When we look below the surface of the daily grind, underneath the circumstances of our daily lives, we can discover that gratitude can be a state of mind that lifts us out of the inconveniences of the day or the difficulty we may find ourselves in the midst of. Gratitude motivates us to take action when others are in need.  It fuels our compassion and prompts us to give.</p>
 
<p>Today I am thankful for you, our alumni, students, faculty and staff who appreciate and support this wonderful learning community we call Eureka College. I am thankful for alumni who have taken what they have learned here and are making their communities, their workplaces and their homes rich, satisfying environments.</p>
 
<p>Gratitude can be a tangible thing when it motivates us to serve our fellow man. The Eureka College community has demonstrated this to tornado victims in their time of need in so many ways.  For that, I am truly thankful.</p>
 
Shellie Schwanke
Director of Alumni Relations - Class of '87

<h3>Dr. Logsdon's Studs Terkel Project Spotlight</h3>

<p>Dr. Loren Logsdon, Professor Emeritus of English, has captured the spirit of Eureka College history in a special project he fondly calls the "Studs Terkel Project." The project is a collection of alumni memories and stories which weave a rich tapestry of the Eureka College experience during the '40s, '50s and '60s.</p>

<p>This collection of stories is available in the Online EC Bookstore. <a href="https://www.bkstr.com/ProductDisplay/10001-10003-230905-4000000000001808297-1?demoKey=d">Order Your Copy today!</a></p>
