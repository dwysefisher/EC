It was published on-line by Athletes in Action, the sports ministry for Campus Crusade for Christ.  It tells about his life and his Christian faith.  The articles can be found at: <a href="www.athletesinaction.org/news">www.athletesinaction.org/news</a> then click on Pro Ministry.</p>

<h3>80's</h3>

<p><b>Mellisa Thompson Holtzman '95</b> was among a select group of researchers and program representatives invited to the White House for a briefing hosted by the Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault. The invitation was extended based on Mellisa's efforts (along with her colleague, Chad Menning) to develop, test, and refine a new sexual assault protection seminar, called Elemental. This seminar has been demonstrated to significantly increase students' self-protection awareness while simultaneously lowering incidences of assault. Few protection programs have produced similar results. Mellisa currently serves as the co-director and lead instructor for Elemental. The program originated at Ball State University, but is now offered at other colleges in the region as well (see <a href="http://www.elementalprotection.org">www.elementalprotection.org</a>).</p>
