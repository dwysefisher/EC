<h4>A Note From Home...</h4>
<h5>Home is where the heart is!</h5>

	<p>The finish line is in our sights and the home stretch is upon us! Yes, today is the last day of class for our students and faculty. Now it is on to finals and the grand finale, commencement! The student stress of finishing projects, presentations and finals will soon transition into the biggest celebration of the year. Yes, commencement is truly a reward for the whole community. It is a privilege seeing our seniors receive their diplomas and transition into the ranks of alumni. </p>
	
	<p>Here in the alumni office, we are enjoying the success of an eventful travel season that took alumni to Florida, Ireland, and Arizona, followed by an outstanding alumni weekend during which we welcomed hundreds of alumni friends home to campus for our Run with Reagan 5K, luncheon with our astronaut in residence Scott Altman, an elegant alumni award celebration dinner, an awesome Chorale concert and the theatre's production, of Godspell. </p>
	
	<p>As we celebrate the end of the academic year on campus, I wish you all joy as you celebrate Mother's Day and your own family celebrations and milestones that this time of year always brings.</p>

<h4>Dr. Logsdon's Studs Terkel</h4>
<p>Dr. Loren Logsdon, Professor Emeritus of English, has captured the spirit of Eureka College history in a special project he fondly calls the &ldquo;Studs Terkel Project.&rdquo; The project is a collection of alumni memories and stories which weave a rich tapestry of the Eureka College experience. </p>

<h5>The Tale of Two Dorothys: Memories of Eureka College's Work Study Program</h5>

<p><b>Dorothy Whitler:</b> The Student Work Plan was important to me because that was one of the advantages that attracted me to the college. My family did not have a lot of finances. So two things happened that helped me. I ranked 4th out of 40 in my graduating class, and if you were in the upper 10th of your class you could qualify for a scholarship that paid $105 per year.</p>

<p>And something else happened to me. A man named Mr. Harding came to visit our home, and he told us there was a chance that I could get a grant. I didn't understand anything about the grant or anything like that. I found out later that it was paid by a man in our church in Cuba, and I had worked for him in the grocery store, and he gave $200 every year. I didn't know where it was coming from. It seems like I was always to go and ask for it, and I would get this grant money every time.</p> 

<p>In the third term I went to inquire, and I could see the paper and I saw the name of the man who was paying for my grant. So immediately my dad talked with him, and I didn't get my fourth year. But anyway, I had that scholarship money, and I had the $200. Dad made me pay for my books, and he paid for the rest of the tuition. I worked as a waitress in Lida's Wood, and I also worked in the library for Mrs. Steider. My senior year I was proctor for Magdalene Hall, and I was the lockup person for that dorm. I would walk through each floor checking people. I don't remember what I was paid for that, but that would be my spending money.</p>

<p><b>Dorothy Logan Sallee:</b> I needed to earn money for some of my expenses, and I usually had several jobs. Each afternoon I swept the dining room and hallway in Lida's Wood for the big sum of $4.40 per week. I also worked in the library for $4.40 per week. Later, I got a coveted job in the kitchen which required longer hours with increased pay. Sometimes I substituted as a waitress in the dining room or as a dishwasher.</p>

<p>During my college career I also did babysitting for several professors' families. And one year I cleaned house for the dean. Another year, I received both pay and credit for instructing a girls' physical education class in tennis and archery. When I became a senior, I gave up debating and many other activities as well as assorted campus jobs for a weekend job as a youth worker at the Glen Oak Christian Church in Peoria. With the exception of sweeping the dining room, the jobs were not usually tedious or boring. In retrospect, I'm sure that they were a significant part of my education. At least I learned that there were some jobs that I did not want to do for the rest of my life.</p>

<p>Strange as it may seem, the job that I remember best was working in the kitchen. I often worked the breakfast shift when all three of the cooks were present. The head cook, Mrs. Dieker, had been with the college many years. She never seemed to get flustered or excited and did a good job of teaching us the various aspects of our jobs. Mrs. Mooney baked the best pies I have ever eaten. The special menu for Wednesday dress-up night in the dining room always included Mrs. Mooney's pies. Almost every morning Heinie Brubaker from maintenance came by for coffee and gossip. Lida's Wood kitchen was definitely the place to be in the morning.</p>
