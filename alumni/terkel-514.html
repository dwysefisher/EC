<h5>When Ronald Reagan came to town</h5>
<h6>John Nebgen</h6>


<p>My employ at Eureka College from 1983 through 1998 brought me into brief association with the 40th president of the United States, Ronald Wilson Reagan.  Ronald Reagan graduated from Eureka College in 1932, and legends concerning his relationship to the college abound.  Reagan came to campus twice while I was on the faculty, and therein lays the point of this essay.</p>

<p>The first visit was February 1984 when President Reagan was invited to initiate a lecture series sponsored by Time Magazine.  He came on his birthday, February 6, which by coincidence was also Founders Day at Eureka College commemorating the date of issue of the college’s charter from the state, February 6, 1855.  Founders Day at Eureka College had traditionally involved a ceremony in the Chapel including a procession by the faculty in their full academic regalia.  That year, the ceremony was held in the gymnasium because of the expected crowd to hear the president of the United States.  One of the major political issues of the times was the recent invasion of Grenada in order to overthrow the elected government that was perceived as being Communist and on the road to becoming a second Cuba in the Caribbean.  Despite the strong pro-Reagan leanings of the College, there were a few souls who disagreed with Ronald Reagan.  These persons decided that they would wear armbands with peace symbols in order to protest the invasion of Grenada.  In my few months on the faculty at that time, I perceived the ringleaders of this movement as being part of the faculty lunatic fringe, which always seems to be present on any campus.  While I too was a bit chagrined at the invasion of Grenada, I did not feel the need to protest, as the issue was one that had been resolved some six months in the past and was water under the bridge.</p>

<p>When word of the protest reached the president of the college, he tried to negotiate with the disgruntled faculty persons.  However, there was great concern over the faculty’s right to free speech and infringement on their academic freedom.  That portion of the faculty and the president of the college were at an impasse.  The college president then cancelled the academic procession.  Therefore, we had to wander into the gathering with the hoi polloi.  There would be no Founders Day ceremony that year.  We must have presented an incongruous sight with Eureka College faculty in our full academic garb sprinkled among other attendees in less formal attire.</p>

<p>I remember nothing from the occasion, except that Ronald Reagan’s 75th birthday was acknowledged, and that well-meaning faculty can readily make mountains out of molehills.</p>

<p>The second occasion when Ronald Reagan came to campus was for Commencement in May 1992.  He had been out of office for more than three years and, as is the case with all ex-presidents, protected by Secret Service agents.  The week prior to his arrival was full of a lot of folderol in preparation for his visit.  Attendance at the graduation ceremony was to be by invitation only.  However, before one could be issued an invitation, he or she must provide the powers that be with their Social Security number so that a background check could be completed.  In addition, the number of tickets issued to graduating seniors and faculty was limited to immediate family and close friends.  No more than six tickets per invited attendee were allowed.</p>

<p>I had always used the week of finals prior to Commencement as a time to clean up laboratories after a year’s worth of activity.  By that time of the year, the labs were really in pretty bad shape.  Dirty dishes particularly were in abundance, along with many nearly empty bottles of this and that.  While I was in my grubby clothes doing the necessary clean-up chores, I received a visit from a well-dressed man who seemed to be very much interested in what I was doing.  It was straight out of the movies where “spooks” make sure that nothing amok is going on.  Of course I was not to suspect that this person was a spook from the Secret Service wanting to make sure that I was not up to some sort of skullduggery.  When he was assured that I was harmless, I looked out the window only to observe that the entire campus was swarming with spooks.  If one did not know better, one would think that it was a reenactment of a Pink Panther movie.</p>

<p>By the time Commencement arrived, the campus had been made secure.  However there was a potential problem with a student who had made some statements deemed threatening to the ex-president.  This student (a freshman) was summarily expelled from the college and taken into custody by the Secret Service.  He happened to have been in my Western Civilization and Culture discussion section, and had impressed me as being something of a screw-up.  Therefore, I was not terribly surprised at the turn of events, and found a new respect for the spooks who were doing their job of making the campus secure.  Nevertheless, I felt that they could have done their job in a more open manner and not attempt to appear so nonchalant in their efforts to uncover potential threats to ex-President Reagan.</p>

<p>Commencement came and we faculty gathered in our academic regalia so that we could march into the outdoor theatre on a warm May afternoon.  As we were going in, I noticed that nothing was really different than other Commencements.  The strict limitation of tickets seemed to be ignored.  At least there appeared to be no one taking tickets or looking for suspicious characters in the audience.  We were told that everyone, including faculty, would have to go through a metal detector.  None was there.  I could only assume that the Secret Service had done a thorough job in their making the campus secure, and that a lot of the preliminary concern had been addressed and no further action was needed.</p>

<p>Once we got to our appointed seats, the ceremony began.  After the usual recognition of student and faculty awards, the ex-president of the United States began his Commencement address.  I remember little of that address except that he made a self-deprecating remark about not having been around during the Thomas Jefferson administration.  I also remember how thankful I was so that the faculty was sitting with their backs to the sun, whereas the dignitaries were seated having to face the sun.</p>

<p>When it came time to deliver diplomas to the hundred or so new graduates, Mr. Reagan arose and positioned himself at the exit of the platform. After the graduating seniors had received their diploma, ex-president Reagan personally shook each graduates hand in an expression of congratulation.  I had never seen such a gracious act done at a graduation ceremony before or since, and came away with a new respect for a person with whose policies I often disagreed.</p>

<p>Another memorable anecdote of the situation was that one graduate, a young female math major, gave the ex-President a handful of Jelly Bellies in return for her handshake with him.  It was a touching incident since Mr. Reagan appeared to be totally at a loss as to how to respond.  However, he did respond gracefully with a shrug indicating, “What do I do now?”  The humor of the situation was greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>This exposure to a more private side of the ex-president was one that I will remember with some satisfaction.  While I did not vote for him for either of the times he ran for president, I did come away with the feeling that he was a caring and sensitive person.  His association with Eureka College has certainly been profitable for the college.  Ex-president Reagan has often said “everything good that has happened to him began during his years at Eureka College.”  His accomplishments after attending have been good for the college, and have been instrumental in establishing the reputation of the college as a place for a good liberal arts education, and a place where good American family values are an integral part of the institution.</p>

<p>My fifteen years at Eureka College and brief associations with Ronald Reagan are certainly memorable.  While I was on an opposite side politically with respect to most of his policies, I did find him to be a good, sensitive, human being during his two visits to Eureka College while I was a member of the faculty.  I suppose that it is a good thing to see a private side of a national leader with whom you have often been at odds.  For that reason, I am eternally grateful for my years at Eureka College.</p>
