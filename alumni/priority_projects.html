<p>Eureka College Renovates Gunzenhauser Hall</p>
<p>RESIDENCE HALL BUILT IN 1927 AS MEMORIAL TO BELOVED DAUGHTER</p>
<p>Magdalene Gunzenhauser was a freshman at Eureka College in 1925 when she fell ill and died, but her father ensured that her memory would live on through the residence hall he built in her name. Now, more than 85 years later, the hall has been restored to its 1920s look as part of a residence halls renovation project across the Eureka College campus.</p>
<p>Originally named Magdalene Hall, the structure was built with funds from George Gunzenhauser, a Eureka College trustee from Batavia. It was completed in 1927 at a cost of $50,000 in the colonial revival style with elements of the 1920s art deco style, including circular portals on the front and back of the building. The general contractor was J. M. Allen, Bloomington. The interior furnishings were by Bowling Brothers, Mt. Carmel.</p>
<p>Magdalene Hall housed approximately 40 coeds who were members of the Phi Omega and Delta Delta Pi social sororities.</p>
<p>For the renovation, college officials wanted to retain the 1920s look wherever possible, according to Vice President for Finance and Facilities Marc Pasteris. The original interior wood doors and hardwood and terrazzo floors were repaired and refinished. Small black and white tiles in a pattern popular in the ‘20s were installed in the bathrooms. The original entryway with two decorative columns and a balcony was repaired.  Outdoor lighting fixtures are reminiscent of the ‘20s, and the new windows feature mullions, replicating the original design.</p>
<p>The building, which houses 37 female students, has new paint, flooring, ceiling and lighting systems, electrical and plumbing upgrades, roof and exterior improvements, sprinkler and fire protection systems, room furnishings, and heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems. Renovations incorporated sustainable strategies, Pasteris said.</p>
<p>The total cost was $1.3 million. Contractor was Core Construction, Morton.</p>
<p>When the residence hall originally opened, George Gunzenhauser placed the face of a sleeping cherub on the frieze above the front door. Today, with its face freshly painted, the cherub remains a reminder of a father’s enduring love.</p>
