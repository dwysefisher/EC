<h4>A Note From Home&hellip;</h4>

<p>The new year is here! Students are back on campus, another semester has begun and for those of us old enough to remember that "3rd term" feeling, a bit of the mid-winter blues has the potential of settling in for a couple of months. So, what can bust us all out of a mid-winter state of mind? Planning something wonderful to look forward to!</p>

<p>With that in mind, the Alumni Relations Office has been busy setting up opportunities for YOU our alumni and friends to enjoy together. WE want to continue to enrich your life and make you proud! Please mark your calendars and plan to join us throughout the coming year. You are sure to come away with a feeling of pride and community as you connect with your alma mater.  </p>

<p>Shellie Schwanke<br />
Director of Alumni Relations &ndash; Class of '87</p>

<h4>Dr. Logsdon's Studs Terkel</h4>
<em>Dr. Loren Logsdon, Professor Emeritus of English, has captured the spirit of Eureka College history in a special project he fondly calls the "Studs Terkel Project." The project is a collection of alumni memories and stories which weave a rich tapestry of the Eureka College experience. </em>

<p><a href="https://medium.com/studs-terkel-project/">Read this month's article by Loren Logsdon</a>.</p>

<p>The Alumni Office would like to continue the spirit of this project by inviting alumni who attended after 1970 to <a href="http://www.eureka.edu/alumni/continuing-studs-terkel/">send in your stories.</a> You can also submit by emailing Dr. Logsdon directly at <a href="mailto:llogsdon@eureka.edu">llogsdon@eureka.edu</a>.

This collection of stories is available in the <a href="http://bit.ly/ecbkstr">Online EC Bookstore </a>.
