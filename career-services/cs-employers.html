<h3 class="first-line"><h3>Career services for employers make your Eureka connection</h3>
<p>Eureka College students have over 25 majors from which to choose to study. They also have over 40 organizations, several athletic teams, and several fraternities to choose to contribute to as members and leaders. The Career Services Office also offers students the opportunity to become involved in Internships from their Sophomore year until graduation, in a variety of locations and businesses. We believe that these kinds of opportunities add to the academic experience at Eureka College and make our students the kind of well-rounded, critical-thinking, good team members employers are looking for their corporation.</p>
<p>Students also participate in a number of job search preparation activities - often sponsored or facilitated by local employers. If you would like to become involved in these activities please contact Career Services.</p>

<p>Employers may post job notices and internships directly to Eureka College students and alumni via <a href="https://www.myinterfase.com/eureka/employer/">EC Career Link</a>, or contact the Director of Career Services for a recruitment plan tailored to your opportunity.</p>
