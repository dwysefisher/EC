<hr class="hr-style">

<h4>Internships</h4>
<p>Internships are an excellent way to learn more about your chosen field, to gain practical working experience, to make network contacts, and to build your resume. Internships receive college credit when registered as a class. Internship credit may be obtained at two levels, 295 and 495, as follows:</p>

<ul class="body-list">
	<li>295: Student must have a minimum 2.25 GPA and six hours of class work in the major area of study.</li>
	<li>495: Student must have a minimum 2.25 GPA and 12 hours of class work in the major area of study, with at least 6 hours at the 300 level.</li>
</ul>

<p>All students may earn up to 16 hours of credit through internships, but these hours do not count toward completion of a major or a minor (see the College Catalog for any exceptions). A student may earn up to 16 hours of credit per internship. Hours of credit are determined by the number of hours the student works on the internship: one hour of credit for every 40 hours worked. Internships being done for academic credit or graded on a pass/fail basis.</p>

<p>Students are also encouraged to make an appointment to meet with the Career Services Director to discuss other resources and information available to help in finding and securing an internship. Internships can also be obtained through faculty, friends, or other contacts. All students desiring an internship must complete an Internship Workshop, a Career Services application, have a written resume, and will be required to complete an agreement form. Make an appointment with Career Services to map out your approach to an internship. Internships being done for academic credit must be pre-approved prior to the beginning of the internship experience.</p> 

<p>All necessary paperwork must be submitted prior to the final day to add courses to one's schedule. Students should be advised that it is completing the required internship paperwork late could impact financial aid and a student's account. Thus, it is recommended that all paperwork be completed early in the prior semester before the internship experience will take place.</p>
