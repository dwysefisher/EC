<h4>Internships</h4>

<p>Faculty members play an integral role in the for-credit internship process.  The Faculty Supervisor, who has agreed to supervise the experience, has the opportunity to indicate if there will be additional requirements that will be evaluated along with the studentâ€™s actual performance at the site.  The faculty supervisor is also asked to include information as to how he/she will supervise and evaluate the experience.  Please be sure to have the faculty member sign in this area acknowledging the evaluation component required at the conclusion of the experience.  Please see the Intern Requirements and Expectations for a more thorough description of the internship process.</p>
