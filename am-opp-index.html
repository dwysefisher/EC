<p class="first-paragraph">At Eureka, we believe that students reach their full potential to learn, serve and lead when they have both the quantity and quality of opportunities for their character to develop in concert with their intellect.</p>

<p>For 161 years, Eureka College has provided every generation of students with these numerous opportunities to grow and develop as leaders in their personal and professional lives.  That is why our graduates include 42 college presidents, seven governors and members of Congress, and of course, the 40th President of the United States.<p>

<p>Today, Eureka College is proud to <a href-="#" title="link to PDF of full report" class="underline">release the findings</a> our first "American Opportunity Index." We have commissioned this survey as a measure of whether Americans feel that they have both the freedom and opportunity to pursue their dreams.  By sharing the index results, we hope that all Americans, like Eureka College graduates, will work toward ensuring the freedom and opportunity for everyone to pursue their dreams. </p>

<p>This index on American opportunity was inspired by the opportunities that Eureka provided for our most famous alumnus, Ronald Wilson Reagan who went from his rural Illinois origins to world leader with five careers in between. </p>

<p>During a return visit to his beloved alma mater, Reagan spoke of American opportunity, saying "the national purpose of our country is to unleash the full talent and genius of every individual." We see the values that Eureka instilled in young Dutch Reagan reflected in this quote.</p>  

<p>In honor of the Eureka College &ndash; Dutch Reagan case study of opportunity that is as alive and vibrant today for our students as it was nearly 75 years ago, we release the findings on his Dutch's birthday which serendipitously falls on the same date of Eureka College's founding, February 6th.</p>

<p>Our research partner for the American Opportunity Index (AOI) is McLaughlin &amp; Associates, a national research and polling firm based in Alexandria, Va.</p>
