<p class="first-paragraph">For 161 years, Eureka College has provided every generation of students with these numerous opportunities to grow and develop as leaders in their personal and professional lives. That is why our graduates include 42 college presidents, seven governors and members of Congress, and of course, the 40<sup>th</sup> President of the United States.<p>

<p>Eureka College is proud to <a href="#" title="link to PDF of full report" class="underline">release the findings</a> our first "American Opportunity Index." We have commissioned this survey as a measure of whether Americans feel that they have both the freedom and opportunity to pursue their dreams.  By sharing the index results, we hope that all Americans, like Eureka College graduates, will work toward ensuring the freedom and opportunity for everyone to pursue their dreams. </p>

<p>This index on American opportunity was inspired by the opportunities that Eureka provided for our most famous alumnus, Ronald Wilson Reagan who went from his rural Illinois origins to world leader with five careers in between. </p>
