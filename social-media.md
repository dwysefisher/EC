As a part of Eureka College’s overall communications plan, our social media strategy is focused on the following questions:
* Who is our audience?
* What is our objective?
* What is our content?

##When

Where

## Notes
Collect regular metrics to gauge how well social media presence is working. But what are we trying to measure?
Mike Jacka & Peter R. Scott, *Auditing Social Media: A Governance and Risk Guide* (Wiley, 2011).

### Questions to ask: 
What is happening? 
What is emerging as a potential risk for the College?
* Reputational Risk
What is our institutional voice?
